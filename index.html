<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Michel Foucault: Maurice Blanchot: The Thought from Outside / Maurice Blanchot: Michel Foucault as I Imagine Him</h2><p><p>In these two essays, two of the most important French thinkers of our time reflect on each other's work. In so doing, novelist/essayist Maurice Blanchot and philosopher Michel Foucault develop a new perspective on the relationship between subjectivity, fiction, and the will to truth. The two texts present reflections on writing, language, and representation which question the status of the author/subject and explore the notion of a "neutral" voice that arises from the realm of the "outside." This book is crucial not only to an understanding of these two thinkers, but also to any overview of recent French thought.Michel Foucault (1927-1984) was the holder of a chair at the College de France. Among his works are Madness and Civilization, The Order of Things, Discipline and Punish, and The History of Sexuality Maurice Blanchot, born in 1907, is a novelist and critic. His works include Death Sentence, Thomas the Obscure, and The Space of Literature.</p></p><p>Michel Foucault (1926&#x2013;84) is widely considered to be one of the most influential academic voices of the twentieth century and has proven influential across disciplines.Text: English (translation) <br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Power of Preaching: Crafting a Creative Expository Sermon (Kingdom Pastor&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p><i>The No-Nonsense Preaching Manual Every Pastor Needs </i></p><p>The first book in the Kingdom Pastor&#x2019;s Library from Tony Evans, <i>The Power of Preaching </i>will help you be faithful to the Word of God and preach with power and conviction.

Since the foundation of the modern discipline of art history in Germany in the late eighteenth century, debates about art and its histories have intensified. Historians, philosophers, psychologists, and anthropologists among others have changed our notions of what art history has been, is, and might be.<br> <em>The Art of Art History</em> is a unique guide to understanding art history through a critical reading of the field's most innovative and influential texts over the past two centuries. Each section focuses on a key issue: aesthetics, style, history as an art, iconography and semiology, gender, modernity and postmodernity, deconstruction and museology. More than thirty readings from writers as diverse as Winckelmann, Kant, Gombrich, Warburg, Panofsky, Heidegger, Lisa Tickner, Meyer Schapiro, Jacques Derrida, Mary Kelly, Michel Foucault, Rosalind Krauss, Louis Marin, Margaret Iversen, and Nestor Canclini are brought together, and Donald Preziosi's introductions to each topic provide background information, bibliographies, and critical elucidations of the issues at stake. His own concluding essay is an important and original contribution to scholarship in the field.</p><p><br><strong>Donald Preziosi</strong> is Professor of Art History at the University of California, Los Angeles. His publications include <em>Rethinking Art History: Meditations on a Coy Science</em> and <em>Minoan Architectural Design</em>.<br>This masterly collection of texts interrogates the raging academic question, What is art history? Editor Preziosi, who directs ground-breaking critical studies of art history and museology, provides introductions to 35 challenging readings gathered in nine chapters. This plethora of alternatives is curiously complicated, even obfuscating. Covered here are the most current and relevant approaches to aesthetics, style, iconography and semiology, feminism, gender studies, formalism, postmodernism, deconstruction, museography, hybridity, and multiculturalism; those offering critical analysis range from Winckelmann, Kant, Wolfflin, Panofsky, Schapiro, Gombrich, and Derrida to Rosalind Krauss and Carol Duncan. Ultimately, this book is best suited to upper- and graduate-level collections and to the reference shelf of specialized art collections, as it proposes the discipline of art history itself as an art.AMary Hamel-Schwulst, Towson Univ., MD<br>Copyright 1998 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Math Triumphs, Grade 2, Student Study Guide, Book 1: Number and Operations (MATH INTRVENTION K-5 (TRIUMPHS))</h2><p>The first intervention program designed around the NCTM Focal Points and can also be a pull out resource.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>AIDS and Accusation: Haiti and the Geography of Blame (Comparative Studies of Health Systems and Medical Care)</h2><p>Does the scientific &#34;theory&#34; that HIV came to North America from Haiti stem from underlying attitudes of racism and ethnocentrism in the United States rather than from hard evidence?

Talbot Donaldson wrote in his first book on Piers Plowman that Langland &#39;in his emphasis on the individual...was in advance of his own church and of his own nation--and, indeed, of himself.&#39; Paradoxically, as Donaldson also recognized, Langland was &#39;a political and religious moderate&#39; whose cast of mind was &#39;conservative and traditionalist.&#39; The poem that resulted from this curious paradox presents one of the great enigmas of all English poetry, as well as one of the major works of the Middle Ages.E. Talbot Donaldson&nbsp;was Distinguished Professor of English Emeritus at Indiana University. His books include Piers Plowman: The C-Text and Its Poets, Chaucer&#x2019;s Poetry: An Anthology for the Modern Reader, and, with George Kane, the definitive edition of Piers Plowman: The B Version.

Using key principles derived from multicultural psychology, they have created a highly accessible guide grounded in the exploration of each user&#x2019;s values, motives, and needs. This book should be studied by anyone who is interested in promoting constructive dialogues with coworkers, friends, acquaintances, and neighbors on potentially divisive topics.

Lopez, PhD<br><br>&#x201c;I admire and respect the intentions behind Anatasia Kim and Alicia del Prado&#x2019;s <i>It&#x2019;s Time to Talk (and Listen)</i>. Constructive conversations about difficult topics are, by definition, very hard to have. Kim and del Prado, in my opinion, treat the ability to have such conversations as a skill that can be learned. The Kim Constructive Conversation Model revolves around the topics of culture and diversity, but the actual model can also be applied broadly to other challenging topics&#x2014;subjects that we often avoid. Perhaps the most important takeaway for me, after reading this text, was the authors&#x2019; heartfelt belief that we can make difficult and painful situations better, especially surrounding diverging views on culture and diversity. And we can do this by following a model of sorts, one that is grounded in our own values and integrity. Thank you Anatasia and Alicia, for sharing your thoughts, suggested instruction, and explicit bias that we can all improve the way we deal with difficult topics.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>David M.

Lechuga, PhD<br><br>&#x201c;For too long, dialogues on multicultural issues turn to debates, trying to prove why each person is right in their respective positions. What I love most about Kim and del Prado&#x2019;s book is the use of their own lives to illustrate their eight-step approach, while situating ALL readers to examine our own &#x2018;stuff&#x2019; as we attempt to honor ourselves while listening to others. The book is practical, with case examples and reflective exercises that can be used by anyone. I love the book&#x2019;s capacity to serve as a model for constructive conversations both within and outside academia. It is accessible, and while an easy read, they challenge us to look beyond simple solutions and Band-Aid approaches to difficult dialogues. Not an easy task, but a necessary one if we are to truly affirm the humanity in others.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Miguel E.

In doing so, the reader is invited to journey inward, and peel away layers of self by identifying intentions, exposing obstacles, and clarifying principles that inform how we act on or react to conversations that may make us uncomfortable.

Here are revealing sketches of every justice from John Jay to Stephen Breyer, as well as portraits of such legal giants as John Marshall, Oliver Wendell Holmes, Earl Warren, and Thurgood Marshall. Astute, provocative, and extremely accessible, <i>A People's History of the Supreme Court</i> illuminates and pays tribute to a system of justice that both reflects and parallels our country's remarkable legal history.<br><br>"Bracing . . . Irons and his book burst with lively and often funny stories that make the history of the institution come alive." --<i>San Francisco Chronicle Book Review</i></p><p>The savvy, chatty author of <i>The Courage of Their Convictions</i> brings us a scholarly reckoning of the 200-plus years of decisions made by the highest court in the land. Not surprisingly (and justifiably, given his erudite arguments), Peter H. Irons represents the court's work as a never-ending appeal of the powerless to the powerful: of the just over 100 supreme justices who have sat on the court, all but two have been white, all but two have been men, and all but seven have been Christian, whereas the supplicants to our nation's highest bar are typically racial minorities, women, and deviants in some way from the religious and social mainstream.<p> Taking a representative (if not comprehensive) accounting of the Supreme Court's most significant decisions, Irons puts cultural and political context--and a human face--to the parties involved, painting an absorbing and involving picture of landmark cases that readers are likely to recall but not fully understand. Whether he's explicating the tortuous history of freedom-seeking slave Dred Scott or explaining the "a Jap's a Jap" reasoning behind the legal exculpation of World War II internment camps, Irons reminds us of the court's spotted history while still conveying the deep affection he has for it.

Known as the earliest autobiography written in the English language, Kempe's <em>Book</em> describes the dramatic transformation of its heroine from failed businesswoman and lustful young wife, to devout and chaste pilgrim.

This new translation by Anthony Bale is presented in idiomatic modern English, but aims to stay true to the style of the original, sometimes homely and familiar, sometimes high-flown and Latinate. It&#39;s wonderfully readable, and has an excellent introduction and notes. Altogether a great pleasure. * Shiny New Books, Harriet Devine * This lively new edition preserves the author&#39;s forceful individuality, but makes her writing accessible to a new audience, and her book not only flings open a forgotten world but also comes garnished with useful notes and maps of her extensive travels. * Good Book Guide, Fiona Lafferty * Bale&#39;s Book of Margery Kempe offers the best modern version of the text and the most comprehensive and judicious assessment of scholarly and critical environments in which to read this strange and wondrous work...

While exploring the environs of their summer home, five brothers and sisters find a Psammead, or Sand-fairy, in a nearby gravel pit: &#x201c;Its eyes were on long horns like a snail&#x2019;s eyes, and it could move them in and out like telescopes; it had ears like a bat&#x2019;s ears, and its tubby body was shaped like a spider&#x2019;s and covered with thick soft fur; its legs and arms were furry too, and it had hands and feet like a monkey&#x2019;s.&#x201d; The Psammead is magical and, every day, the ancient and irritable creature grants each of them a wish that lasts until sunset. Soon they find their wishes never seem to turn out right and often have unexpected&#x2014;and humorous&#x2014;consequences. And when an accidental wish goes terribly wrong, the children learn that magic, like life, can be as complicated as it is exciting. <i>Five Children and It</i>&nbsp;continues to be one of our most enduring stories, as fantastical and as it is true to the wonders of childhood.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>E. NESBIT was a mischievous, tomboyish child who grew up to be an unconventional adult. She and her husband were founding members of the socialist Fabian Society and their home became a center for socialist and literary discussion. Their friends included some of the time's greatest writers and thinkers, including George Bernard Shaw and H. G. Wells. Everything about Edith showed her as a woman trying to break out of the mold demanded by English society at the time&#x2014;she expressed her individuality through her clothes, hairstyle, lifestyle and her habit of speaking forcefully on almost any subject. She lived her socialism and late in life her charitable deeds brought her close to bankrupcy. Nesbit started to write for children after years of successful writing for adult magazines. She was asked to write about her childhood but instead of facts chose to describe her happy girlhood in fiction and was brilliant at combining real-life situations with elements of fantasy and humor. She passed away in 1924.<br>JESSICA HISCHE is a letterer, illustrator, typographer, and web designer.

And every time they passed a house, which was not very often, they all said, "Oh, is this it?" But it never was, till they reached the very top of the hill, just past the chalk quarry and before you come to the gravel pit. And then there was a white house with a green garden and an orchard beyond, and Mother said, "Here we are!"<br><br>"How white the house is," said Robert. <br><br>"And look at the roses," said Anthea.<br><br>"And the plums," said Jane. <br><br>"It is rather decent," Cyril admitted. <br><br>The Baby said, "Wanty go walky"; and the fly stopped with a last rattle and jolt.<br><br>Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to get out of the carriage that very minute, but no one seemed to mind. Mother, curiously enough, was in no hurry to get out; and even when she had come down slowly and by the step, and with no jump at all, she seemed to wish to see the boxes carried in, and even to pay the driver, instead of joining in that first glorious rush round the garden and the orchard and the thorny, thistly, briery, brambly wilderness beyond the broken gate and the dry fountain at the side of the house. But the children were wiser, for once. It was not really a pretty house at all; it was quite ordinary, and Mother thought it was rather inconvenient, and was quite annoyed at there being no shelves, to speak of, and hardly a cupboard in the place. Father used to say that the ironwork on the roof and coping was like an architect's nightmare. But the house was deep in the country, with no other house in sight, and the children had been in London for two years, without so much as once going to the seaside even for a day by an excursion train, and so the White House seemed to them a sort of fairy palace set down in an earthly paradise. For London is like prison for children, especially if their relations are not rich.<br><br>Of course there are the shops and the theatres, and Maskelyne and Cook's, and things, but if your people are rather poor you don't get taken to the theatres, and you can't buy things out of the shops; and London has none of those nice things that children may play with without hurting the things or themselves--such as trees and sand and woods and waters. And nearly everything in London is the wrong sort of shape--all straight lines and flat streets, instead of being all sorts of odd shapes, as things are in the country. Trees are all different, as you know, and I am sure some tiresome person must have told you that there are no two blades of grass exactly alike. But in streets where the blades of grass don't grow, everything is like everything else. This is why so many children who live in towns are so extremely naughty. They do not know what is the matter with them, and no more do their fathers and mothers, aunts, uncles, cousins, tutors, governesses, and nurses; but I know. And so do you now. Children in the country are naughty sometimes, too, but that is for quite different reasons.<br><br>The children had explored the gardens and the outhouses thoroughly before they were caught and cleaned for tea, and they saw quite well that they were certain to be happy at the White House. They thought so from the first moment, but when they found the back of the house covered with jasmine, all in white flower, and smelling like a bottle of the most expensive scent that is ever given for a birthday present; and when they had seen the lawn, all green and smooth, and quite different from the brown grass in the gardens at Camden Town; and when they had found the stable with a loft over it and some old hay still left, they were almost certain; and when Robert had found the broken swing and tumbled out of it and got a lump on his head the size of an egg, and Cyril had nipped his finger in the door of a hutch that seemed made to keep rabbits in, if you ever had any, they had no longer any doubts whatever.<br><br>The best part of it all was that there were no rules about not going to places and not doing things. In London almost everything is labeled "You mustn't touch," and though the label is invisible it's just as bad, because you know it's there, or if you don't you jolly soon get told.<br><br>The White House was on the edge of a hill, with a wood behind it--and the chalk quarry on one side and the gravel pit on the other. Down at the bottom of the hill was a level plain, with queer-shaped white buildings where people burnt lime, and a big red brewery and other houses; and when the big chimneys were smoking and the sun was setting, the valley looked as if it was filled with golden mist, and the limekilns and oasthouses glimmered and glittered till they were like an enchanted city out of the Arabian Nights.<br><br>Now that I have begun to tell you about the place, I feel that I could go on and make this into a most interesting story about all the ordinary things that the children did--just the kind of things you do yourself, you know--and you would believe every word of it; and when I told about the children's being tiresome, as you are sometimes, your aunts would perhaps write in the margin of the story with a pencil, "How true!" or "How like life!" and you would see it and very likely be annoyed. So I will only tell you the really astonishing things that happened, and you may leave the book about quite safely, for no aunts and uncles either are likely to write "How true!" on the edge of the story. Grown-up people find it very difficult to believe really wonderful things, unless they have what they call proof. But children will believe almost anything, and grown-ups know this. That is why they tell you that the earth is round like an orange, when you can see perfectly well that it is flat and lumpy; and why they say that the earth goes round the sun, when you can see for yourself any day that the sun gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night like a good sun as it is, and the earth knows its place, and lies as still as a mouse. Yet I daresay you believe all that about the earth and the sun, and if so you will find it quite easy to believe that before Anthea and Cyril and the others had been a week in the country they had found a fairy. At least they called it that, because that was what it called itself; and of course it knew best, but it was not at all like any fairy you ever saw or heard of or read about.</p><h2>Globalization: The Transformation of Social Worlds (The Wadsworth Sociology Reader Series)</h2><p>This popular and thought-provoking reader collects interesting and insightful articles that explore the process of globalization and how it shapes societies and groups.

Mouse and her friends decide to play tug-of-war after watching kids at recess. First, though, they have to decide how to make both sides equal. They try dividing up by meat-eaters and plant-eaters; then they try those that have fur versus those without. Neither of these solutions works. Then they try three animals on each side. Of course, the larger ones win. Finally, they line up on the teeter-totter, shifting sides until the board balances. With both teams equal, the effort to win the tug-of-war is also equal. Neither side is victorious until Bear is distracted by the buzz of bees. Though predictable in a number of ways, the story still has enough plot tension to keep children reading. The illustrations, done in pastel shades, have a certain charm that young readers will find inviting. At the end of the book, Kroll gives the four definitions of equal from the viewpoints of math, art, the law, and team sports. This is an additional purchase for those collections needing more math-related books.<i>&#x2013;Elaine Lesh Morgan, Multnomah County Library, Portland, OR</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

His troubled, tempestuous life paralleled the upheavals in American society during the 1960s and 1970s, and his desperate quest to prove his manhood was uncomfortably akin to the macho image projected by three successive presidents in their "tough" policy in Southeast Asia. <i>Looking for a Hero</i> extracts the real Joe Hooper from the welter of lies and myths that swirl around his story; in doing so, the book uncovers not only the complicated truth about an American hero but also the story of how Hooper's war was lost in Vietnam, not at home. <p>Extensive interviews with friends, fellow soldiers, and family members reveal Hooper as a complex, gifted, and disturbed man. They also expose the flaws in his most famous and treasured accomplishment: earning the Medal of Honor. In the distortions, half-truths, and outright lies that mar Hooper's medal of honor file, authors Peter Maslowski and Don Winslow find a painful reflection of the army's inability to be honest with itself and the American public, with all the dire consequences that this dishonesty ultimately entailed.

Overall, the book guides readers on how to incorporate motivational interviewing techniques in their clinical practice, summarizes current research on the wide-ranging application of motivational interviewing, and highlights new and promising directions....The editors and authors have offered a volume that is likely to do what they do best: motivate the field to examine important questions in the service of helping clients for change." (<i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> 2007-10-20)<br><br>"Strong evidence is provided in Motivational Interviewing in the Treatment of Psychological Problems that not only is MI here to stay, but, in fact, the application of MI has great potential as a treatment modality for helping with many diverse issues....The editors have wisely chosen contributions from bona fide experts....On a very practical level, this volume offers something for everyone and covers the spectrum, from new clinicians just learning about the field, to experienced clinicians open to broadening their views, to researchers wanting to contribute to their own area of concentration. Additionally, the book is well worth the read for those who do not practice MI but who want to keep abreast of current trends in the treatment of psychological problems and/or the applications of motivational interviewing....For those familiar with the traditional MI use in the substance abuse treatment field, it may come as a surprise to see the different areas where the use of MI is being explored. For others familiar with the use for other behavioral changes and more recently in correctional settings, the astonishment will be in seeing MI used for so many other psychological problems....Each chapter is clear, providing background information for the specific topic and examples of the application of MI in the particular setting. My only complaint is that I wanted more! If you have to choose one book among the plethora of recent editions on MI, this would be the book to buy....Has something for everyone interested in psychological problems. It is appropriate for new clinicians, seasoned clinicians not familiar with MI, and even&#x2015;or maybe especially&#x2015;for those of us who are experienced motivational interviewers and MI trainers." (<i>PsycCRITIQUES</i> 2007-10-20)<br><br>"A practical guide, edited by the leading experts and developers of this technique....This is one of a series of highly accessible volumes by Miller and Rollnick that review the empirical evidence base and present easy-to-implement strategies, illuminating concrete examples, and clear-cut guidance on integrating motivational interviewing with other psychological interventions....I approached the text as a researcher interested in integrating motivational interviewing in the treatment of adolescents dually diagnosed with PTSD and substance abuse, a population hard to engage and motivate. What I found was an excellent step-by-step guide to motivational interviewing rich in clinical vignettes and therapist&#x2013;patient dialogues illustrating how to manage various clinical scenarios with skill and sensitivity. The chapters also succinctly review motivational interviewing research for each type of problem under consideration, and also highlight areas where more research is needed. I found the chapters thought-provoking in generating my own research questions and methods for testing the application of motivational interviewing for improving engagement and outcomes for my patients. The authors provide a clear message that there are fundamental components of motivational interviewing that make it what it is....Therapists and researchers who are seeking a positive, respectful, and collaborative approach for helping diverse patients make positive change and for improving psychological interventions&#x2014;this book is for you."

The seventh edition brings attention to the major challenges and issues that are shaping education in the second decade of the twenty-first century, including major changes in the teaching profession, the classroom, and the board room, increased involvement of state and federal governments in education, the movement toward national standards, the continued emphasis on student achievement data and the push to include these data in pay-for-performance compensation and value-added evaluation, the rapid growth and support for charter schools, and the minority to majority demographic shift in the student population which all have major impacts on&nbsp; the future of education in the United States.&nbsp; </p></p><p></p><h2>Complete Poems of Whitman (Wordsworth Poetry Library)</h2><p>Walt Whitman&#39;s verse gave the poetry of America a distinctive national voice. It reflects the unique vitality of the new nation, the vastness of the land and the emergence of a sometimes troubled consciousness, communicated in language and idiom regarded by many at the time as shocking. Whitman&#39;s poems are organic and free flowing, fit into no previously defined genre and skilfully combine autobiographical, sociological and religious themes with lyrical sensuality. His verse is a fitting celebration of a new breed of American and includes Song of Myself, Crossing Brooklyn Ferry, the celebratory Passage to India, and his fine elegy for the assassinated President Lincoln, When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom&#39;d.</p><p>Walt Whitman was an American poet and writer born in New York in 1819. Despite his family s financial troubles, Whitman attended school and, after graduating at age eleven, worked in a lawyer s office before becoming a printer s apprentice. Before he had even turned sixteen Whitman began anonymously publishing his poetry at the Long Island Star, where he worked. After leaving the Star, Whitman moved through several jobs including teaching, publishing and typesetting. Eventually, though, Whitman determined to make his living writing poetry, and paid for the first publication of Leaves of Grass himself when he was thirty-seven. At the time of its publication, Leaves of Grass was met with controversy and was criticized for its overtly sexual themes, however, but it has since come to be one of the most important works in early American literature and a product of the transcendentalist movement. Whitman died in 1892 at the age of seventy-two.</p><h2>Data Structures: Abstraction and Design Using Java</h2><p>This book lays the foundation for programmers to build their skills.

Original. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Stephen Harrod Buhner is a master herbalist, psychotherapist, and an expert on indigenous and contemplative spiritual traditions. Much of his work and writing focuses on herbal and alternative healing, deep ecology, and sacred plant medicine.This informative though sometimes frustrating guide to using herbal and natural remedies to treat the symptoms of middle age is actually three works in one. Buhner, an herbalist, begins with an excellent introduction in which he argues that the midlife "crisis" for a man is better seen as a "natural process" in the "aging of the self," a "movement into new territories of the self" that requires a better understanding of the workings of a man's body chemistry. Second, while he is not a medical doctor, Buhner does explain the research he has done in understanding the male body, in lengthy sections describing the workings of the various body parts. Third, Buhner presents an amazing range of herbal and plant remedies for various diseases related to the body parts he discusses. If readers want to know how juniper berries can aid urinary tract infections, or how ginkgo can be used in treating the heart and the mind, Buhner is a knowledgeable guide. However, his argument for the use of these herbs and supplements is rooted in a more general argument that "middle-age" problems are the result of changing levels of the male hormone androgen, which leads him to some general and strict suggestions such as his list of "things to avoid"-which includes aspirin, antibiotics and antifungal drugs as well as antidepressants. Ultimately, this book will best serve those readers already familiar with herbal medicines and ready to follow the highly specific dietary suggestions. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Foundations of the Vocational Rehabilitation Process</h2><p>The book is free of highlighting.</p><p></p><h2>The Pilgrim&#39;s Progress: Hendrickson Christian Classics</h2><p>Pilgrim&#39;s Progress: From This World to That Which Is to Come; Delivered Under th</p><p>John Bunyan (1628-88) was an English preacher and writer who wrote over sixty books and tracts.

On this forgotten intersection, the American dream has crumbled to a nightmare. Here, the full price of the drug culture is being paid--yet, surprisingly, it can also be a place of hope, caring, and love.<br><br>This extraordinary book tells the searing true story of one year in the life of an inner-city neighborhood. <br><br>Written by David Simon, the award-winning author of <b>Homicide,</b> and Edward Burns, a former police detective, it follows a handful of people who must struggle mightily just to survive--let alone escape--the drug market that fuels their world. At the center of the narrative is fifteen-year-old DeAndre McCullough. DeAndre's parents, Gary and Fran, were once poised, against all odds, to pull themselves up and out of West Baltimore. But when they themselves stumble and then succumb to the corner's temptations, DeAndre's future hangs in the balance. Smart and streetwise, he is both drawn to and wary of the drug trade that flourishes beyond his rowhouse steps. Can he rise above his parents' addiction, or will he, too, become a casualty of the corner?<br><br>In telling the story of DeAndre and his broken family, Simon and Burns open up the complex world of the corner and its unforgettable characters. It's a place of predators and their prey, of slingers and touts, of stickup boys and shooting gallery nurses, of ambivalent police, helpless users, and innocent bystanders. But it is also, incredibly, a place of fragile hope. Fat Curt, an aging drug tout, remembers the corner as a kinder place, and tries to protect his customers from weak or dangerous product. R.C., a troubled teenager, finds refuge from his chaotic life within the basketball court's magic boundaries. Ella, a longtime resident, runs the recreation center for the corner's children, shielding them as best she can from what lies outside the playground's chain-link fence. Amid so much desperation, decency still flickers, poignantly, across the corner's blasted landscape.<br><br>More vividly than any recent book, <b>The Corner</b> captures an America of which many of us are only dimly aware. Through the prism of just one desolate crossroads, Simon and Burns offer chilling assessments of why law enforcement policies, moral crusades, and the welfare system have done so little for our inner cities. Deeply moving and unflinchingly real, <b>The Corner</b> will forever alter our view of the so-called war on drugs, even as it compels us to look deep into the hearts and minds of all those who live in America's abandoned places.</p><p>This startling look at desperate, drug-addled inner-city lives ranks as one of the grittiest--and best--examinations of underclass America available. Like Alex Kotlowitz's <i>There Are No Children Here</i> and Leon Dash's <i>Rosa Lee</i>, <i>The Corner</i> shines light on a horrific subculture of addiction, crime, dependency, and violence. Authors David Simon (who wrote <i>Homicide</i>, the book that inspired the TV series of the same name) and Edward Burns (a former cop) are muckraking reporters who operate in the finest tradition of American journalism. They spent an entire year on the corner of Fayette and Monroe in West Baltimore, getting to know its open-air drug market and its people. Although the authors present strong evidence that the so-called war on drugs cannot be won, <i>The Corner</i> has no political agenda. It is simply a powerful testament to the bleak situation confronting many urban neighborhoods. At once deeply unsettling and extremely rewarding, this humane book deserves a wide audience.Praise for <i>The Corner:</i><p><i>"The Corner</i> is an intimate, intense dispatch from the broken heart of urban America. It is impossible to read these pages and not feel stunned at the high price, in human potential, in thwarted aspirations, that simple survival on the streets of West Baltimore demands of its citizens. An important document, as devastating as it is lucid."<br>--Richard Price, author of <i>Clockers</i></p><p><i>"The Corner</i> is a remarkable book--very tough, very demanding, very rewarding. Some of it is brutal and all of it is heartbreaking. As a reporter, I can only stand back and admire David Simon and Edward Burns for an amazing piece of reportage. To be there for an entire year, to make sense of random events and a list of characters long enough to make Charles Dickens envious, and to write coherently--it's a breathtaking achievement. And they manage to make West Baltimore as much a character as any of the flesh-and-blood people in the book."<br>--Glenn Frankel, author of <i>Beyond the Promised Land</i></p><p>"If you want to understand street-corner life in the inner city, you should read <i>The Corner,</i> an amazingly intimate, detailed work of reporting that makes human and vivid a world that outsiders ordinarily are forced to learn about through statistics, sound bites, and stereotypes."<br>--Nicholas Lemann, author of <i>The Promised Land</i></p></p><h2>Management of Organizational Behavior: Leading Human Resources</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Used by more than a million people throughout the world, this highly readable book provides a comprehensive examination of the applied behavioral sciences, and focuses on fundamental ideas which have stood the test of years of application in academic, business, not-for-profit and administrative environments. <b> </b> Complete coverage of motivation and behavior, situational leadership, building effective relationships, planning and implementing change, leadership strategies, the organizational cone and integrating situational leadership with the Classics. <b> </b> For individuals interested in expanding their knowledge of, and proficiency in leadership strategies. </p></p><p></p><h2>Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach</h2><p>Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach, Second Edition is an introductory text that incorporates phylogenetic principles and methods throughout&#x2014;from the careful explanation of phylogenetic methods and principles in the initial two chapters to the taxonomic survey of vascular plant families in the last two chapters. <p>Orders and families are recircumscribed to represent monophyletic groups, largely following the most recent classification of the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group. The sources of taxonomic evidence are discussed, including morphology, anatomy, embryology, chromosomes, palynology, secondary plant compounds, proteins, and DNA. Molecular taxonomic methods are fully presented, and throughout the book reference is made to the results of recent studies, both molecular and morphological. A chapter on the history of plant classification puts current systematic methods in a historical context. Issues relating to variation in plant populations and species, including discussion of speciation, species concepts, polyploidy, hybridization, breeding systems, and introgression are carefully considered. Botanical nomenclature and field and herbarium methods are discussed in two appendices. New to the Second Edition are a chapter presenting an overview of the phylogeny of the green plants (with an emphasis on the vascular plants), a detailed glossary of botanical and biological terms, and coverage of 16 additional families of vascular plants. All chapters have been thoroughly updated, taking into account recent taxonomic methods and hypotheses. </p><p>The text is copiously illustrated, using in large part the informative analytical drawings developed as part of the Generic Flora of the Southeastern United States project. The text is accompanied by a much expanded CD-ROM, containing over 2,200 color photos illustrating the diagnostic characters of (and variability within) the vascular plant families covered in the text, including many images showing floral and fruit dissections.</p></p><p>WALTER S.

Newly translated by the team of Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky, who have enlivened the Russian classics for a new generation, this selection of 11 of his finest stories reveals a Tolstoy of many sides and unsurpassed storytelling talents. Along with smaller gems like "Alyosha the Pot," the collection features a handful of thrilling longer tales that each carry the power of a novel: the terrifying murderer's confession of "The Kreuzer Sonata," the breathlessly dramatic path of a single crime through dozens of lives in "The Forged Coupon," and the haunting account of the isolation of mortality in the legendary title story. Most revelatory of all for a modern reader is the final novella, and Tolstoy's final work, "Hadji Murat," the disturbingly contemporary story of a fiercely honorable Chechen warrior caught between local rivalries and the ambivalent reach of a decadent empire. <i>--Tom Nissley</i>Together, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have translated works by Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Chekhov, and Gogol. They were twice awarded the PEN/Book-of-the-Month Club Translation Prize (for their versions of Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i> and Tolstoy&#x2019;s <i>Anna Karenina</i>), and their translation of Dostoevsky&#x2019;s <i>Demons</i> was one of three nominees for the same prize.

The elegant and adventurous array of dresses, uniforms, and other attire is a feast for the eyes and a fascinating examination of pure craft and of the brilliant, creative minds behind it. The collection begins with a summation of the costumes created for Disney animation, early live action, and television, along with show wardrobes sported at the Disney Parks by Audio-Animatronics figures and Cast Members. The next section details a timeless case study: Cinderella's ball gown. A diverse group of designers has been called upon over the years to address and improvise the creative and practical needs each time the fairy tale <em>Cinderella</em> has been reimagined. Each project has brought with it inherent cultural challenges when bringing a familiar and beloved tale to life again and again, and all have yielded stunning and distinct results. At last, the full galleries (organized by the character archetypes of heroes and villains, and those complex, always interesting, "spaces between") showcase costumes across more than thirty Disney films. At each turn, this volume offers a one-of-a-kind backstage view of remarkable works of art, and it inspires a true appreciation for the highly skilled and talented costumers who created them.</p><p><p>JEFF KURTTI is a leading authority on The Walt Disney Company, its founder, and its history.

It allowed us to really focus on the best in design and craft in the current Disney cinematic canon-and frankly, in the current cinematic canon, period.

It runs the gamut from Dorothy's costume in 1985's <em>Return to Oz</em>, to the Genie, Aladdin, and Jasmine from this year's live-action <em>Aladdin</em>.

Share in Sylvia Browne&#x2019;s extraordinary lessons of wisdom and comfort from The Other Side....</b><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Keeping life in perspective is difficult for everyone. For many, holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries become overwhelming events; not to mention job changes, family crises, and personal issues. We become preoccupied with things we cannot change and lose sight of what really matters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now renowned psychic and #1 <b>New York Times</b> bestselling author Sylvia Browne helps us celebrate and appreciate life by reminding us of the countless blessings we received before coming into this world. With chapters on forgiveness, past lives, contacting The Other Side, and discovering life&#x2019;s purpose, Sylvia Browne tells uplifting stories of people she has helped to find their way. Sylvia Browne believes that, if we can remember why we are here and what we are supposed to be doing here, our lives will ultimately become happier, healthier, and more spiritually fulfilling.</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>In <i>Blessings from the Other Side</i>, bestselling author and renowned psychic Sylvia Browne offers down-to-earth advice on living in the here and now. Using her warm, "tell-it-like-it-is" voice, Browne addresses her favorite lecture-tour topics, such as taking care of unfinished business with a deceased loved one, finding forgiveness, raising children, and even coping with the holidays (or "hell-idays," as she playfully calls them). Each chapter includes stories of past life encounters as well as anecdotes from <i>this</i> life. Presumably her cowriter Lindsay Harrison deserves credit for the well-crafted writing. Browne, however, deserves credit for the extremely comforting advice in this book. Clearly she wants readers to forge a stronger relationship with God as they mend broken relationships, push through their grief, or simply make it through another overwhelming day. Every chapter offers a nurturing and highly visual guided meditation exercise as well as a closing affirmation. <i>--Gail Hudson</i><b>Sylvia Browne</b>&nbsp;was a psychic and the #1 <i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of <i>End of Days</i>,&nbsp;<i>Blessings from the Other Side</i>, <i>Adventures of a Psychic,</i>&nbsp;<i>The Other Side&nbsp;and Back</i>,&nbsp;and <i>Life on the Other Side</i>.&nbsp;<br><br><b>Lindsay Harrison</b>&nbsp;is a writer and teacher living in New York City.</p><h2>Psychology with DSM-5 Update (11th Edition)</h2><p><p>This access code card gives you access to all of MyPsychLab's tools and resources, including a complete eText of your book.

I don&#x2019;t ever remember actually learning the mechanics but I have faint memories of knitting fingerless gloves in a lemon acrylic yarn! As I got a little older I began knitting garments for myself (as well as my dolls). I always had a big supply of cotton yarn available as my aunt owned a wool shop in Dublin. <br><br> For many years after that I did not knit at all. In fact, I almost forgot how to knit! My first child was born in Florida and when he was still small we returned to Ireland. The weather was so much colder I longed to knit some warm jumpers (sweaters) for him but didn&#x2019;t have enough time to relearn. Several children later I came across a new Irish online yarn shop (www.thisisknit.ie) and gave in to the desire to pick up my knitting needles again! <br><br> Once I began knitting again I was unstoppable, I tore through every knitting book I could find, and within 6 months I started designing. I find designing knits to be the perfect blend of the artistic and engineering sides of my brain, which makes me very happy on multiple levels. <br><br> <b>I am just learning to knit and look forward to designing a few new patterns myself. What advice do you have for new designers? </b><br> Don&#x2019;t be afraid to experiment, and practice your pattern writing. When you are starting out you may find that patterns need to be rewritten several times before the directions make sense to other knitters. They then need to be read and knit by several people (and the numbers checked) before you reach a point that they are ready for the general public. <br><br> Knitters are very inventive and creative. However the pattern writing part of designing often takes a good deal of practice, and not everyone enjoys it! <br><br> <b>What are the characteristics of traditional Aran patterns? </b><br> The concept of a traditional Aran pattern is actually a bit of a misnomer! Complex cabled Aran patterns are a relatively modern invention, dating from the mid-20th century. The Aran Islands was a very poor area and the sale of complex knitwear produced by the women on the islands was a vital source of income. The patterns they produced were a complex blending of cable patterns with highly textured stitches. The traditional yarn used for these garments was a cream (banin) 100% wool yarn that was very rich in wool oil (lanolin). <br><br> <b>What are your thoughts on natural fibers like cotton and wool and bamboo versus synthetics like acrylic? </b><br> My own personal preference is for natural fibers. I like that they are breathable, comfortable to wear and very durable, for the most part. I especially like to use 100% wool yarns that are more durable. Often they can be a little rougher to knit when you are working with them but as soon as you wash them they soften beautifully. The huge advantage that they have over slightly softer yarns is that they wear really, really well. When you use a cardigan every day over a cold winter it is nice to know that it will look just as well at the end of the winter! <br><br> I do use yarns with acrylic content also when it is of benefit to do so. Sock yarn is a good example of this; socks take a huge amount of abuse and the addition of nylon helps them last much longer. I also like some blends of cotton and acrylic as it still retains the nature of cotton but by having an acrylic content you reduce the heaviness of 100% cotton especially for heavier weight yarns. <br><br> <b>What&#x2019;s the favorite thing you&#x2019;ve ever knitted? </b><br> That&#x2019;s a really hard question! I&#x2019;ve probably got several different answers; I knit a shrug for my sister&#x2019;s wedding (Summer affair) a couple of years ago that I felt very proud seeing her wear on her wedding day. The cardigan which is shown on the front cover of Contemporary Irish Knits was also very satisfying. I had envisioned that pattern in my head almost a year before knitting it. It took me that long to figure out how to knit it in a way that would make it possible to write an easy to follow pattern for it. <br><br> In terms of the knit I wear most often, that would be a Felted Tweed version of my Akoya pattern. It is in a lighter weight yarn and I wear it summer and winter! <br><br> <b>Where do you get your inspiration for pieces? </b><br> Sometimes an idea comes to me when I&#x2019;m swatching with a yarn; I&#x2019;ll start experimenting with the yarn using different stitch patterns and an idea starts to form. Other times I&#x2019;ll see a clothing detail and I&#x2019;ll wonder how that could be interpreted in knitting to make a fun knit and beautiful garment. Still other times, I began brainstorming ideas around a particular theme (although I often find I head in a totally different tangent!) <br><br> The inspiration for the book was a combination of all these different ways of working. The textured Irish yarn and subtle color blends were lots of fun to swatch with, especially with complex cabled patterns. The overall theme of the book was also always in my mind. I wanted to create a collection of designs inspired by tradition, but still very contemporary, flattering and wearable. <br><br> <b>Tell us about your construction methods, why or how are they unique/ different? </b><br> I enjoy unusual construction methods, especially if they are seamless. The knitted fabric is flexible and versatile; knitting seamless takes full advantage of this. I knit garments from the bottom up, top down and even from side to side! All of the garments in the book Contemporary Irish Knits are worked seamlessly. When a garment is knit in one piece it makes it very easy for the knitter to try it on as they are working to ensure that they are getting a good fit. This also means that if you need to make any adjustments for your own particular body type, you can ensure you are doing so in the right location. Simple additions such as short rows to shape shoulders (rather than stepped bind offs) make for smooth lines and a more pleasant knitting experience. <br><br> <b>Can you tell us a little about the Mills and the history behind them? </b><br> Until a few years ago I knew very little about milling and even less about Irish mills. Researching this book was a voyage of discovery for me with some interesting surprises along the way. I was astonished to discover how few mills still commercially produce yarns for hand knitters; I found only 3! These mills are sprinkled around the country. One is very far north (&#x2018;Donegal Yarns&#x2019; in Donegal), &#x2018;Cushendale Woollen Mills&#x2019; is closer to the center of the country in County Kilkenny, and &#x2018;Kerry Woollen Mills&#x2019; is located close to Killarney in the South west of the country. Each of these mills produces their own unique style of yarn. Donegal produces a yarn with colored tweed flecks through it, Cushendale produces a lighter weight yarn in subtle, complementary shades and Kerry is the only mill in Ireland spinning organic fleece when it is available. <br><br> Each of these mills has been in operation for several generations, with information being passed on and techniques improved by each generation. The yarn each produces is beautiful and unique and deserves to be cherished as a distinctly Irish, usable yarn. <br><br> <b>Do your sons knit or know how to knit? Or do they just like wearing what you make them? </b><br> Three of my four sons knit and my youngest (who is 5) desperately wants to know how, but can&#x2019;t quite manage it yet! My oldest son knit a hat for himself last summer with yarn he dyed himself using Kool Aid, and he wears it nearly every day. My 10 year old knit an entire sweater for himself last winter &#x2013; he was very proud of himself (as was I!) It was a top down raglan sweater that he finished with minimal help from me. My third boy likes to keep his hands busy and finds knitting great for his concentration. <br> <br> <b>Sample Patterns</b><br><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> Glengesh: Cable-and-Lace Wrap<br>(Click for pattern) </td> <td> Ardara: Women&#x2019;s Tunic Cardigan<br>(Click for pattern) </td> </tr> </tbody></table> <br> <br><b>Celebrate the rich tradition of Irish knitting and create up-to-the-minute pieces with timeless style</b><p><i>Contemporary Irish Knits</i> gives you 20 exciting patterns for making one-of-a-kind Aran-inspired knits, including unique projects for women's, children's, and men's pieces as well as accessories like blankets, shawls, hats, and fingerless mittens.

It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Using the simple. powerful language of a fable, Hemingway takes the timeless themes of courage in the face of defeat and personal triumph won from loss and transforms them into a magnificnet twentieth-century classic.</p><p>Here, for a change, is a fish tale that actually does honor to the author. In fact <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> revived Ernest Hemingway's career, which was foundering under the weight of such postwar stinkers as <i>Across the River and into the Trees</i>. It also led directly to his receipt of the Nobel Prize in 1954 (an award Hemingway gladly accepted, despite his earlier observation that "no son of a bitch that ever won the Nobel Prize ever wrote anything worth reading afterwards"). A half century later, it's still easy to see why. This tale of an aged Cuban fisherman going head-to-head (or hand-to-fin) with a magnificent marlin encapsulates Hemingway's favorite motifs of physical and moral challenge. Yet Santiago is too old and infirm to partake of the gun-toting machismo that disfigured much of the author's later work: "The brown blotches of the benevolent skin cancer the sun brings from its reflection on the tropic sea were on his cheeks. The blotches ran well down the sides of his face and his hands had the deep-creased scars from handling heavy fish on the cords." Hemingway's style, too, reverts to those superb snapshots of perception that won him his initial fame: <blockquote> Just before it was dark, as they passed a great island of Sargasso weed that heaved and swung in the light sea as though the ocean were making love with something under a yellow blanket, his small line was taken by a dolphin. He saw it first when it jumped in the air, true gold in the last of the sun and bending and flapping wildly in the air. </blockquote> If a younger Hemingway had written this novella, Santiago most likely would have towed the enormous fish back to port and posed for a triumphal photograph--just as the author delighted in doing, circa 1935. Instead his prize gets devoured by a school of sharks. Returning with little more than a skeleton, he takes to his bed and, in the very last line, cements his identification with his creator: "The old man was dreaming about the lions." Perhaps there's some allegory of art and experience floating around in there somewhere--but <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> was, in any case, the last great catch of Hemingway's career. <i>--James Marcus</i>2 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Human Geography: People, Place, and Culture</h2><p><i><b>Human Geography</b></i> 10th Edition includes all of the important concepts and theory on Human Geography as previous issues with a more succinct and engaging narrative while going in depth to touch on all the major themes of the topic.

These books, among them <i>Notes of a Native Son</i>,<i> The Fire Next Time</i>, <i>Giovanni&#x2019;s Room</i>, and <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>,<i> </i>brought him well-deserved acclaim as a public intellectual and admiration as a writer. However, Baldwin&#x2019;s earliest writing was in poetic form, and Baldwin considered himself a poet throughout his lifetime. Nonetheless, his single book of poetry, <i>Jimmy&#x2019;s Blues</i>, never achieved the popularity of his novels and nonfiction, and is the one and only book to fall out of print.<br><br> This new collection presents James Baldwin the poet, including all nineteen poems from <i>Jimmy&#x2019;s Blues</i>, as well as all the poems from a limited-edition volume called <i>Gypsy</i>, of which only 325 copies were ever printed and which was in production at the time of his death. Known for his relentless honesty and startlingly prophetic insights on issues of race, gender, class, and poverty, Baldwin is just as enlightening and bold in his poetry as in his famous novels and essays. The poems range from the extended dramatic narratives of &#x201c;Staggerlee wonders&#x201d; and &#x201c;Gypsy&#x201d; to the lyrical beauty of &#x201c;Some days,&#x201d; which has been set to music and interpreted by such acclaimed artists as Audra McDonald. Nikky Finney&#x2019;s introductory essay reveals the importance, relevance, and rich rewards of these little-known works. Baldwin&#x2019;s many devotees will find much to celebrate in these pages.</p><p><b>James Baldwin</b> (1924&#x2013;1987) was a novelist, essayist, playwright, poet, and social critic, and one of America&#x2019;s foremost writers. His writing explores palpable yet unspoken intricacies of racial, sexual, and class distinctions in Western societies, most notably in mid-twentieth-century America. A Harlem, New York, native, he primarily made his home in the south of France. He is the author of several novels and books of nonfiction, including <i>Notes of a Native Son</i>, <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain</i>, <i>Giovanni&#x2019;s Room</i>, <i>Another Country</i>, <i>Tell Me How Long the Train&#x2019;s Been Gone</i>, <i>If Beale Street Could Talk</i>, <i>Just Above My Head</i>, <i>The Fire Next Time</i>, <i>No Name in the Street</i>, and <i>The Evidence of Things Not Seen</i>, and of the poetry collection <i>Jimmy&#x2019;s Blues</i>.Playing by Ear, Praying for Rain:&nbsp;The Poetry of James Baldwin<br> &nbsp;<br> Baldwin was never afraid to say it. He made me less afraid to say it too.<br><br> The air of the Republic was already rich with him when I got here. James Arthur Baldwin, the most salient, sublime, and consequential American writer of the twentieth century, was in the midst of publishing his resolute and prophetic essays and novels: <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain </i>(1953), <i>The</i> <i>Amen Corner </i>(1954), <i>Notes of a Native Son </i>(1955), and <i>Giovanni&#x2019;s</i> <i>Room </i>(1956). I arrived on planet earth in the middle of his personal and relentless assault on white supremacy and his brilliant, succinct understanding of world and American history. In every direction I turned, my ears filled a little more with what he always had to say. His words, his spirit, mattered to me. Black, gay, bejeweled, eyes like orbs searching, dancing, calling <i>a spade a spade</i>, in magazines and on the black-and-white TV of my youth. Baldwin, deep in thought and pulling drags from his companion cigarettes, looking his and our danger in the face and never backing down. My worldview was set in motion by this big, bold heart who understood that he had to leave his America in order to be. Baldwin was dangerous to everybody who had anything to hide. Baldwin was also the priceless inheritance to anybody looking for manumission from who they didn&#x2019;t want or have to be. Gracious and tender, a man who had no idea or concept of his place<i>, </i>who nurtured conversation with Black Panthers and the white literati all in the same afternoon. So powerful and controversial was his name that one minute it was there on the speaker&#x2019;s list for the great August 28, 1963, March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, and then, poof, it was off. The country might have been ready to march for things they believed all God&#x2019;s children should have in this life, but there were people, richly mis-educated by the Republic, who were not ready for James Baldwin to bring truth in those searing ways he always brought truth to the multitudes.<br> &nbsp;<br> The eldest of nine, a beloved son of Harlem, his irreverent pride and trust in his own mind, his soul (privately and sometimes publicly warring), all of who he was and believed himself to be, was exposed in his first person, unlimited voice, not for sale, but vulnerable to the Republic. Baldwin&#x2019;s proud sexuality, and his unwillingness to censor his understanding that sex was a foundational part of this life even in the puritanical Republic and therefore should be written, unclothed, not whispered about, not roped off in some back room, informed all of his work, but especially his poetry. Uninviting Baldwin was often the excuse for the whitewashing of his urgent and necessary brilliance from both the conservative Black community and from whites who had never heard such a dark genius display such rich and sensory antagonism for them. Into the microphone of the world Baldwin leaned&#x2014;never afraid to say it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Only once did I see James Baldwin live and in warm, brilliant person; it was 1984, a packed house at the University of California at Berkeley. I was thirty-seven, he was sixty, and we would never meet. None of us there that night, standing shoulder to shoulder, pushed to the edge of our seats, knew that this was our last embrace with him, that we would only have him walking among us for three more years. I remember the timbre of his voice. Steadfast. Smoky. Serene. His words fell on us like a good rain. A replenishing we badly needed. All of us standing, sitting, spread out before this wise, sharp-witted, all-seeing man.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had <i>met </i>James Baldwin by way of his &#x201c;Sweet Lorraine,&#x201d; a seventeen-hundred-and seventy-six-word loving manifesto to his friend and comrade, the playwright Lorraine Hansberry. Hansberry died from cancer at the age of thirty-four, soon after her great work, <i>To Be Young, Gifted, and Black</i>, yanked the apron and head rag off the institution of the American theater, Broadway, 1959. Baldwin&#x2019;s intimate remembrance became the introduction to the book of the same name, a book that, as a girl of fourteen, I was highly uncomfortable ever letting out of my sight. I was the Black girl dreaming of a writing life and Hansberry, the Black woman carving one out. Hansberry had given me two atomic oars to zephyr me further upstream: <i>I am a writer. I</i> <i>am going to write. </i>After her untimely death, I had a palpable need to still see and feel her in the world. Baldwin&#x2019;s lush remembrance brought her to me in powerful living dimension. His way of seeing her, of remembering what was important about her, helped her stay with me.<br> &nbsp;<br> I had needed Hansberry to set my determination forward for my journey. And I needed Baldwin to teach me about the power of rain.<br> &nbsp;<br> Baldwin wrote poetry throughout his life. He wrote with an engaged, layered, facile hand. The idea being explored first cinched, then stretched out, with just enough tension to bring the light in. His language: informal, inviting; his ideas from the four corners of the earth, beginning, always, with love:<br> <i><br> No man can have a harlot</i><br> <i>for a lover</i><br> <i>nor stay in bed forever</i><br> <i>with a lie.</i><br> <i>He must rise up</i><br> <i>and face the morning sky</i><br> <i>and himself, in the mirror</i><br> <i>of his lover&#x2019;s eye.</i><br> (&#x201c;A Lover&#x2019;s Question&#x201d;)<br><br> Baldwin&#x2019;s images carry their weight and we, the reader, carry their consequence. In one turn of phrase and line, something lies easy in repose; in the next, he is telling the Lord what to do; the words jump, fall in line, with great and marching verve:<br> <i><br> Lord,</i><br> <i>when you send the rain,</i><br> <i>think about it, please,</i><br> <i>a little?</i><br> <i>Do</i><br> <i>not get carried away</i><br> <i>by the sound of falling water,</i><br> <i>the marvelous light</i><br> <i>on the falling water.</i><br> <i>I</i><br> <i>am beneath that water.</i><br> <i>It falls with great force</i><br> <i>and the light</i><br> <i>Blinds</i><br> <i>me to the light.</i><br> (&#x201c;Untitled&#x201d;)<br><br> Baldwin wrote as the words instructed, never allowing the critics of the Republic to tell him how or how not. They could listen in or they could ignore him, but he was never their boy, writing something they wanted to hear. He fastidiously handed that empty caricature of a Black writer back to them, tipping his hat, turning back to his sweet Harlem alley for more juice.<br> &nbsp;<br> James Baldwin, as poet, was incessantly paying attention and always leaning into the din and hum around him, making his poems from his notes of what was found there, making his outlines, his annotations, doing his jotting down, writing from the mettle and marginalia of his life, giving commentary, scribbling, then dispatching out to the world what he knew and felt about that world. James Baldwin, as poet, was forever licking the tip of his pencil, preparing for more calculations, more inventory, moving, counting each letter being made inside the abacus of the poem. James Baldwin, as poet, never forgot what he had taught me in that seventeen-hundred-and-seventy-six-word essay&#x2014;to remember where one came from. So many of the poems are dedicated back to someone who perhaps had gone the distance, perhaps had taught him about the rain: <i>for David (</i>x<i>3)</i>, <i>for Jefe</i>, <i>for Lena Horne</i>, <i>for Rico</i>, <i>for Berdis</i>, <i>for Y.S.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> When the writer Cecil Brown went to see James Baldwin in Paris in the summer of 1982, he found him &#x201c;busy working on a collection of poems,&#x201d; quite possibly these poems. Brown reports that Baldwin would work on a poem for a while and then stop from time to time to read one aloud to him. &#x201c;Staggerlee wonders&#x201d; was one of those poems, and &#x201c;Staggerlee wonders&#x201d; opens <i>Jimmy&#x2019;s Blues</i>, the collection he published in 1983. The poem begins with indefatigable might, setting the tone and temperature for everything else in this volume, as well as the sound and sense found throughout Baldwin&#x2019;s <i>oeuvre</i>. &#x201c;Baldwin read to me from the poem with great humor and laughter,&#x201d; Brown wrote in his book <i>Stagolee Shot Billy</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br><i>He felt that Black men in America, as the most obvious targets of white oppression, had to love each other, to warn each other, and to communicate with each other if they were to escape being defined only in reaction to that oppression. They had to seek and find in their own tradition the human qualities that white men, through their unrelenting brutality, had lost.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I do not believe James Baldwin can be wholly read without first understanding white men and their penchant for tyranny and &#x201c;unrelenting brutality.&#x201d; If you read Baldwin without this truth, you will mistake Baldwin&#x2019;s use of the word <i>nigger </i>as how he saw himself, instead of that long-suffering character, imagined, invented, and marched to the conveyor belt as if it was the hanging tree, by the founding fathers of the Republic, in order that they might hold on for as long as possible to &#x201c;the very last white country the world will ever see&#x201d; (Baldwin, &#x201c;Notes on the House of Bondage&#x201d;).<br> <i>I always wonder</i><br> <i>what they think the niggers are doing</i><br> <i>while they, the pink and alabaster pragmatists,</i><br> <i>are containing</i><br> <i>Russia</i><br> <i>and defining and re-defining and re-aligning</i><br> <i>China,</i><br> <i>nobly restraining themselves, meanwhile,</i><br> <i>from blowing up that earth</i><br> (&#x201c;Staggerlee wonders&#x201d;)<br> &nbsp;<br> With prophetic understanding, harmony, and swing, creating his own style and using his own gauges to navigate the journey, Baldwin often wrote counter-metrically, reflecting his African, Southern, Harlem, and Paris roots. &#x201c;What do you like about Emily Dickinson?&#x201d; he was once asked in a <i>Paris Review </i>interview. His answer: &#x201c;Her use of language . . . Her solitude, as well, and the style of that solitude. There is something very moving and in the best sense funny.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> James Baldwin made laughter of a certain style even as he reported the lies of the Republic. He was so aware of that other face so necessary in this life, that face that was present in all the best human dramatic monologues, the high historic Black art of laughing to keep from crying. He knew that without the blues there would be no jazz. Just as Baldwin dropped you into the fire, there he was extinguishing it with laughter.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Neither (incidentally)</i><br> <i>has anyone discussed the Bomb with the niggers:</i><br> <i>the incoherent feeling is, the less</i><br> <i>the nigger knows about the Bomb, the better:</i><br> <i>the lady of the house</i><br> <i>smiles nervously in your direction</i><br> <i>as though she had just been overheard</i><br> <i>discussing family, or sexual secrets,</i><br> <i>and changes the subject to Education,</i><br> <i>or Full Employment, or the Welfare rolls,</i><br> <i>the smile saying, </i>Don&#x2019;t be dismayed.<br> We know how you feel. You can trust us.<br> (&#x201c;Staggerlee wonders&#x201d;)<br> &nbsp;<br> Baldwin wrote poetry because he felt close to this particular form and this particular way of saying. Poetry helped thread his ideas from the essays, to the novels, to the love letters, to the book reviews, stitching images and feeling into music, back to his imagination. From the beginning of his life to the very end, I believe Baldwin saw himself more poet than anything else: The way he cared about language. The way he believed language should work. The way he understood what his friend and mentor, the great<br> American painter Beauford Delaney, had taught him&#x2014;to look close, not just at the water but at the oil sitting there on top of the water. This reliable witnessing eye was the true value of seeing the world for what it really was and not for what someone reported, from afar, that it was.<br> &nbsp;<br> When Baldwin took off for Switzerland in 1952, he carried recordings by Bessie Smith, and he would often fall asleep listening to them, taking her in like the sweet Black poetry she sang. It must have been her <i>Baby don&#x2019;t worry, I got</i> <i>you </i>voice and their shared blues that pushed him through to finish <i>Go Tell It on the Mountain </i>in three months, after struggling with the story for ten years. Whenever Baldwin abandoned the music of who he was and how that sound was made, he momentarily lost his way. When he lost his way, I believe it was poetry that often brought him back. I believe he wrote poetry throughout his life because poetry brought him back to the music, back to the rain. The looking close. The understanding and presence of the oil on top of the water. Compression. Precision. The metaphor. The riff and shout. The figurative. The high notes. The blues. The reds. The whites. This soaking up. That treble clef. Bass. Baldwin could access it all&#x2014;and did&#x2014;with poetry.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>He was standing at the bath-room mirror,</i><br> <i>shaving,</i><br> <i>had just stepped out of the shower,</i><br> <i>naked,</i><br> <i>balls retracted, prick limped out of the</i><br> <i>small,</i><br> <i>morning hard-on,</i><br> <i>thinking of nothing but foam and steam,</i><br> <i>when the bell</i><br> <i>rang.</i><br> (&#x201c;Gypsy&#x201d;)<br> &nbsp;<br> Baldwin integrated the power of sex and the critical dynamics of the family with ease. He spoke often and passionately about the preciousness of children, the beloved ones. He never hid from any language that engaged the human conundrum, refusing to allow the narrow world to deny him, Black, bejeweled, Harlem insurgent, demanding to add his poetic voice to all others of his day. Sometimes employing a simple rhyme scheme and rhythm, as in &#x201c;The giver,&#x201d; a poem dedicated to his mother, Berdis, and then,<br> again, giving rise to poetic ear-play in &#x201c;Imagination.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Imagination</i><br> <i>creates the situation,</i><br> <i>and then, the situation</i><br> <i>creates imagination.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>It may, of course,</i><br> <i>be the other way around:</i><br> <i>Columbus was discovered</i><br> <i>by what he found.</i><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> In several of his last interviews you hear James Baldwin repeat something you know is on his mind: &#x201c;The older you get, the more you realize the little you know.&#x201d; This Black man of the Black diaspora, born in 1924, the same year that J.

Cast out and divorced by her husband, she finds herself in a strange new world. Both obstacles and support systems change as she actively participates in the struggle for Moroccan independence from France.</p><p>This feminist novel is a literary statement in a modern realist style. Many novels by women of the Middle East that have been translated reflect Western views, values, and education. By contrast, Year of the Elephant is uniquely Moroccan and emerges from North African Islamic culture itself. Its subtle juxtaposition of past and present, of immediate thought and triggered memory, reflects the heroine's interior conflict between tradition and modern demands.

Notes on an Archaeology of Design</h2><p>The question <i>Are We Human?</i> is both urgent and ancient. Beatriz Colomina and Mark Wigley offer a multilayered exploration of the intimate relationship between human and design and rethink the philosophy of design in a multi-dimensional exploration from the very first tools and ornaments to the constant buzz of social media. The average day involves the experience of thousands of layers of design that reach to outside space but also reach deep into our bodies and brains. Even the planet itself has been completely encrusted by design as a geological layer. There is no longer an outside to the world of design. Colomina&#x2019;s and Wigley&#x2019;s field notes offer an archaeology of the way design has gone viral and is now bigger than the world. They range across the last few hundred thousand years and the last few seconds to scrutinize the uniquely plastic relation between brain and artifact. A vivid portrait emerges. Design is what makes the human. It becomes the way humans ask questions and thereby continuously redesign themselves.</p><p>Beatriz Colomina is Professor of Architecture at the Princeton University and Director of the interdisciplinary program Media and Modernity.

What if the government decided to invent a great lie to justify a disastrous war? What would happen to the people who know the truth? EXTREME PREJUDICE delivers an explosive, high tension expose of the real facts surrounding the CIA&#39;s advance warning of 9/11 and an insider&#39;s look at Iraqi Pre-War Intelligence, told by one of the very few U.S. Assets covering Iraq before the War. It reveals the depths of deception by leaders in Washington and London to promote a successful image of their terrorism policy, and the shocking brutality to suppress the truth of their failures from Americans and the world community.</p><p>Former Congressional staffer Susan Lindauer covered Iraq and Libya at the United Nations, as a U.S. Intelligence Asset and back door channel on anti-terrorism from 1993 to 2003. Most notoriously, in the summer of 2001, her team warned about a major terrorist attack involving airplane hijackings and a strike on the World Trade Center. Lindauer also campaigned heavily against the War in Iraq, and developed a comprehensive peace framework through her back-channel in the run up to War. This is the story of what happened when Lindauer tried to disclose the true facts of Iraqi Pre-War Intelligence and the 9/11 warning to Congress and the American people. It details the nightmare of her arrest on the Patriot Act and her imprisonment without a trial at the notorious prison inside Carswell Air Force Base in Texas.

In the tradition of Anton Chekhov and William Carlos Williams, he draws on his experiences in medicine to write stories of great subtlety and striking insight. Osipov&#x2019;s fiction presents a nuanced, collage-like portrait of life in provincial Russia&#x2014;its tragedies, frustrations, and moments of humble beauty and inspiration. The twelve stories in this volume depict doctors, actors, screenwriters, teachers, entrepreneurs, local political bosses, and common criminals whose paths intersect in unpredictable yet entirely natural ways: in sickrooms, classrooms, administrative offices and on trains and in planes. Their encounters lead to disasters, major and minor epiphanies, and&#x2014;on occasion&#x2014;the promise of redemption.</p><p><b>Maxim Osipov</b> (b. 1963) is a Russian writer and cardiologist.

In 2005, while working at a local hospital in Tarusa, a small town ninety miles from Moscow, Osipov established a charitable foundation to ensure the hospital&#x2019;s survival. Since 2007, he has published short stories, novellas, essays, and plays, and has won a number of literary prizes for his fiction.

Like all her novels (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility), the narrative is simple, straightforward and the story develops through seemingly commonplace conversations and events. Emma is twenty one year old daughter to rich Mr Woodhouse, &#34;full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.&#34; The story captures how Emma comes to terms with her own errors of judgement, and how she discovers her liking and love for one of the chief characters of the novel.</p><p>Of all Jane Austen's heroines, Emma Woodhouse is the most flawed, the most infuriating, and, in the end, the most endearing. <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>'s Lizzie Bennet has more wit and sparkle; Catherine Morland in <i> Northanger Abbey</i> more imagination; and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>'s Elinor Dashwood certainly more sense--but Emma is lovable precisely because she is so imperfect. Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus.

The tale unfolds through a series of letters between two friends as one man learns more about Helen Huntingdon and the past that brought this young painter and single mother to Wildfell Hall. Powerfully plotted and unconventionally structured, <em>The Tenant of Wildfell Hall</em> is now considered to be a classic of Victorian literature. </p> <p> This Broadview Edition includes a critical introduction that situates the novel in significant Victorian debates, and provides appendices that make clear Bront�&#x2019;s intellectual inheritance from important eighteenth-century writers such as Hannah More and Mary Wollstonecraft. Material on temperance, education, childrearing, and nineteenth-century women artists is also included in the appendices. </p></p><p>Over a short period in the 1840s, the three Bront� sisters working in a remote English <br>parsonage produced some of the best-loved and most-enduring of all novels: Charlotte's Jane Eyre, Emily's Wuthering Heights, and Anne's The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, a book that created a scandal when it was published in 1848 under the pseudonym Acton Bell.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compelling in its imaginative power and bold naturalism, the novel opens in the autumn of 1827, when a mysterious woman who calls herself Helen Graham seeks refuge at the desolate moorland mansion of Wildfell Hall. Bront�'s enigmatic heroine becomes the object of gossip and jealousy as neighbors learn she is escaping from an abusive marriage and living under an assumed name. A daring story that exposed the dark brutality of Victorian chauvinism, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall was nevertheless attacked by some critics as a celebration of the same excesses it criticized.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every reader who has felt the power of Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights comes, sooner or later, to The Tenant of Wildfell Hall," observed Bront� scholar Margaret Lane. "Anne Bront�, with all the Bront� taste for violence and drama, and with her experience of the same rude scenes and savage Yorkshire tales that had fed the imaginations of her sisters, did not shrink. She used the material at hand, and shaped it with singular honesty and seri-<br>ousness....Anne is a true Bront�." <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This edition of The Tenant of Wildfell <br>Hall is the companion volume to the Mobil Masterpiece Theatre WGBH television presentation broadcast on PBS.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

Lesbian pulp author Valerie Taylor skillfully paints a sociological portrait of the emotional and economic pitfalls of heterosexuality in 1950s America and then offers a defiantly subversive alternative. A classic pulp tale showcasing predatory beatnik men, drug hallucinations, and secret lesbian trysts, <i>The Girls in 3-B</i> approaches the theme of sex from the stiffened vantage point of 1950s psychology.<br><br><b>Femmes Fatales</b> restores to print the best of women&#x2019;s writing in the classic pulp genres of the mid-20th century.

With the $500 proceeds of her first novel, <i>Hired Girl</i> (1953), Taylor bought a pair of shoes, two dresses, and hired a divorce lawyer. After leaving her husband, she kicked off a prolific career as the author of pulp fiction novels, poetry (under the name of Nacella Young), and romances (under the name Francine Davenport). A long-time activist for gay and lesbian rights, she was a co-founder of Mattachine Midwest and the Lesbian Writers Conference in Chicago.<br>Originally published in 1959 and reissued as part of the Feminist Press's new Femme Fatale series of pulp fiction by women writers, this is genre literature with a few twists. Three young women move to Chicago and room together; each wants to emancipate herself from smalltown mores. Annice, a would-be poet, dreams of associating with the intelligentsia; Pat is a secretary in a publishing firm who develops a powerful attraction to her engaged boss; and Barby is a stunning shop clerk whose sexual desire for her supervisor-a female-takes her by surprise but ultimately enriches her life. Searching for their true identities in an era that values sanitized, middle-class, heterosexual conventions, the girls are faced with the classic choice between "good boys" and "bad boys." Annice is torn between nihilistic artist Alan and stable Midwesterner Jackson, who is studying to be a physicist; Pat must weigh Blake, her philandering boss, against Stan, a junior company man with a longstanding crush on her. The book's insights into issues like sexual abuse, infidelity, the corporate glass ceiling, drug experimentation (there is a wild three-page peyote trip that rivals some Beat writers' renditions) and sexual double standards (and how to manipulate them) are surprisingly modern, though two of the three protagonists eventually drift toward conventional happiness. This is a refreshing entry for the genre, mercifully devoid of the moralistic and cautionary elements common in much 1950s pulp. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Biology: Concepts &amp; Connections</h2><p>Hard to find</p><p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>This #1 best-selling text in introductory biology combines the guiding principles of scientific accuracy, currency, and the power of text-art integration for teaching and learning biology.</strong><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Biology: Concepts &amp; Connections, Sixth Edition</strong>continues to be the most accurate, current, and pedagogically effective non-majors text on the market.

Andrew Ferguson moves chronologically through successive generations of Zen masters, supplementing their core teachings with history, biography, and poetry. The result is an organic understanding of the tradition's evolution as a religious, literary, and historical force. Capturing the austere beauty of the Zen masters' manner of teaching &#x2014; their earthy style, humor, and humanity &#x2014; <i>Zen's Chinese Heritage</i> is an intimate and profound human portrait of the enlightened Zen ancients, and an unprecedented look into the depths of this rich cultural heritage. The book includes a deluxe fold-out lineage chart of the Zen ancestors.</p><p>The history of Zen can be almost as perplexing as its cryptic koan. In many accounts of Zen history, it is hard to tell who is Chinese and who is Japanese, who lived in the 6th century and who in the 16th. Andy Ferguson attempts to clear the air once and for all. In <i>Zen's Chinese Heritage</i>, he organizes all of the Chinese Zen masters from Bodhidharma at the turn of the 5th century to Huikai in the 13th century, presenting their core records and writings in chronological order by generation--25 generations in all. Drawing from <i>Wudeng Huiyan</i> (<i>Compendium of Five Lamps</i>) and other records, Ferguson translates the classic Zen teachings (including dialogues, anecdotes, and koan) in spare, straightforward language. He also presents an expertly arranged foldout lineage chart of the Zen ancestors, with cross-referencing by Japanese, Chinese <i>pinyin</i>, and Chinese Wade-Giles transcriptions. Ferguson's work is not only a priceless treasury of Zen literature but also a road map to the history of Zen. <i>--Brian Bruya</i>A member of the San Francisco Zen Center, Andrew Ferguson is a writer and translator who lives in Petaluma, California.<br> <br>Steven Heine is an authority on Japanese religion and society, especially the history of Zen Buddhism and the life and works of Dogen.

In the oceans, though, living space has both vertical and horizontal dimensions: with an average depth of 3800 meters, the oceans offer 99% of the space on Earth where life can develop. And the deep sea, which has been immersed in total darkness since the dawn of time, occupies 85% of ocean space, forming the planet&#x2019;s largest habitat.&nbsp; Yet these depths abound with mystery. The deep sea is mostly uncharted&#x2014;only about 5 percent of the seafloor has been mapped with any reasonable degree of detail&#x2014;and we know very little about the creatures that call it home. Current estimates about the number of species yet to be found vary between ten and thirty million.&nbsp; The deep sea no longer has anything to prove; it is without doubt Earth&#x2019;s largest reservoir of life.</p><p>Combining the latest&nbsp;scientific discoveries&nbsp;with astonishing color&nbsp;imagery, <i>The Deep</i> takes readers on a voyage into the darkest realms of the ocean. Revealing nature&#x2019;s oddest and most mesmerizing creatures in crystalline detail,<i> The Deep </i>features more than two hundred color photographs of terrifying sea monsters, living fossils, and ethereal bioluminescent creatures, some photographed here for the very first time. Accompanying these breathtaking photographs are contributions from some of the world&#x2019;s most respected researchers that examine the biology of deep-sea organisms, the ecology of deep-sea habitats, and the history of deep-sea exploration.</p><p>An unforgettable visual and scientific tour of the teeming abyss, <i>The Deep</i> celebrates the incredible diversity of life on Earth and will captivate anyone intrigued by the unseen&#x2014;and unimaginable&#x2014;creatures of the deep sea.&nbsp; </p></p><p><p><b>Claire Nouvian </b>is a journalist, producer, and film director who has traveled the world for more than ten years, shooting wildlife for French and international television.

Fifteen short, jargon-free essays assembled by editor and French journalist &nbsp;Nouvian . . . flesh out the fantastical images with scientific fact. They dismiss the myth of deep sea monsters and describe the amazing persistence of life around hydrothermal vents and methane flues; a thoughtful glossary adds to this impressive book's popular appeal.&#x201d;</p> (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br><p>"In the first century A.D., Pliny the Elder&#x2014;in a bout of oceanic hubris&#x2014;pronounced that there were precisely 176 species of marine fauna and that, 'by Hercules, in the ocean . . . nothing exists which is unknown for us.' Would that we could summon Pliny from his celestial Hall of Shame and thwack him over the head with Claire Nouvian's <i>The Deep: The Extraordinary Creatures of the Abyss.</i> For this book contains 220 color plates of life-forms whose existence was unknown not merely to Pliny but to anyone at all until the modern development of submersibles capable of plunging to depths that are the inverse of a Mount Everest. Only 5% of the seafloor has been mapped, and scientists estimate that there are between 10 million and 30 million species in the 'vasty deep' yet to be found by man. The ones that we do know&#x2014;and many of those are pictured in this book&#x2014;are gloriously bizarre critters that appear to have been fashioned by Salvador Dali. They bear pulse-quickening names that are as if from some weird children's fable: naked sea butterflies, spookfish, pigbutt worms, cutthroat eels, helmet jellies, glasshead grenadiers and yeti crabs. Hued in pink, red, blue, orange, white and purple, these deep-sea denizens can seem repulsive, with their fangs and hooks and hooded eyes. Many of them, however, are balletic little beauties&#x2014;bioluminescent, geometrical designs that hum with a life beyond our reach, but not, anymore, beyond our imagination.

Bejeweled creatures&#x2014;squid, comb jellies, octopuses, and tube worms&#x2014;leap off the black pages in such a luminescent rainbow that you can't help but realize that the 'blackness' of the depths is a misnomer. In many case, photographs of these organisms appear in this book for the first time anywhere. . . . Such intimate photographs are surely the book's triumph. But an articulate and informative commentary accompanies them."</p> (Richard Ellis <i>Discover</i> 2007-04-01)<br><br>"Outstanding&nbsp;images of deep-sea life drape the pages of <i>The Deep</i>. Inevitably these include the fish that can, in the words of deep-sea pioneer William Beebe, 'outdragon' any figment of human imagination. Equally welcome is the showing this book gives to invertebrates. My favourite is the giant isopod <i>Bathynomus</i>, whose alien face looms out at us. This visual feast is accompanied by equally evocative essays from deep-sea biologists: Cindy Van Dover, director of Duke University's marine lab in North Carolina, narrates a history of deep-sea exploration, for example, while Craig Young, director of the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology, describes the scale of the ocean floor. Words and images combine to convey what we know&#x2014;and how much we don't know&#x2014;about life in our planet's largest habitat." (Jon Copley <i>New Scientist</i> 2007-04-27)<br><br>"This superbly designed large-format book of photographs of deep-sea creatures, eloquently edited by a French journalist and film director, with brief and highly readable contributions from sixteen leading scientific explorers of the deep, is eye-poppingly magnificent. So much so that it provokes gasps of amazement and awe at the complexity, beauty and uniqueness of life in the abyss. One frequently finds oneself wondering whether the weird creatures floating in the darkness like visiting space aliens can really exist&#x2014;except in the minds of special-effects artists. . . . Easily in the same visual league as the BBC's series Planet Earth, <i>The Deep</i> provides a lot more knowledge than the television series for those who want it, without at any point overwhelming the non-biologist reader. . . .<i>The Deep</i> deserves to become a modern classic of natural history." (Andrew Robinson <i>Literary Review</i> 2007-05-01)<br><br><p>"Nouvian's <i>The Deep</i> features more than 200 color portraits of the planet's least-known creatures: sparkling pink octopi like floating lanterns; iridescent squid with corkscrew tails; predatory fish with hooded eyes and translucent teeth looming in the darkness. Some of these are the first-ever photographs of certain organisms. At least eight of the pictures feature animals so unknown that Nouvian's captions list them as 'unidentified.' To page through her book is to feel as if you are peering at life on another planet: It is a vision of the deep as a vast, balletic swarm of nature's inventiveness."</p> (Anthony Doerr <i>Boston Globe</i> 2007-05-20)<br><br><p>&#x201c;The book is composed of giant (frequently larger-than-life-size) photographs of deep-sea creatures: the gelatinous <i>Pandea rubra</i>, which bears an uncanny resemblance to a police strobe light; the seed-like larvae of the <i>Spantagoid</i> heart urchin, whose appendages stretch at near-perfect right angles; glass octopi like living x-rays, frilled sharks, furry lobsters. In all, nearly 200 creatures, some of which have never been photographed before, many of which are unknown species, all of which seem unreal, incomprehensible even. Nouvian divides the organisms roughly in half&#x2014;&#x2018;Life at the Bottom&#x2019; is one cluster, &#x2018;Life in the Water Column&#x2019; another&#x2014;and intersperses the photos with short essays written by marine biologists from around the world. These pieces cover everything from the history of deep-sea exploration to the truth about sea monsters to the science behind bioluminescence (&#x2018;without any doubt the most widely used mode of communication on the planet&#x2019;) and, thankfully, are both excellently written and spare. They provide background without ever detracting from the point&#x2014;the creatures themselves. Early on, Nouvian includes a telling quote by deep-sea explorer Robert Ballard (of Titanic-discovery fame): &#x2018;At a time when most think of outer space as the final frontier, we must remember that a great deal of unfinished business remains here on Earth.&#x2019; <i>The Deep</i> highlights just how accurate that outlook is.&#x201d;</p> (Abby Seiff <i>Popular Science blog</i> 2007-05-16)<br><br>"Bizarre species from as far down as four and half miles are shown in remarkable detail, their tentacles lashing, eyes bulging, lights flashing.

A seadevil looks like something out of a bad dream. A Ping-Pong tree sponge rivals artwork that might be seen in an upscale gallery.

Many still vividly remember exactly where they were and what they were doing when they heard about the tragedy. In <i>The Challenger Launch Decision,</i> Diane Vaughan recreates the steps leading up to that fateful decision, contradicting conventional interpretations to prove that what occurred at NASA was not skulduggery or misconduct but a disastrous mistake.<br><br>Journalists and investigators have historically cited production problems and managerial wrong-doing as the reasons behind the disaster. The Presidential Commission uncovered a flawed decision-making process at the space agency as well, citing a well-documented history of problems with the O-ring and a dramatic last-minute protest by engineers over the Solid Rocket Boosters as evidence of managerial neglect. <br><br>Why did NASA managers, who not only had all the information prior to the launch but also were warned against it, decide to proceed? In retelling how the decision unfolded through the eyes of the managers and the engineers, Vaughan uncovers an incremental descent into poor judgment, supported by a culture of high-risk technology. She reveals how and why NASA insiders, when repeatedly faced with evidence that something was wrong, normalized the deviance so that it became acceptable to them. <br><br>No safety rules were broken. No single individual was at fault. Instead, the cause of the disaster is a story not of evil but of the banality of organizational life. This powerful work explains why the Challenger tragedy must be reexamined and offers an unexpected warning about the hidden hazards of living in this technological age.</p><p><b>Diane Vaughan </b>is professor of sociology and international and public affairs at Columbia University.Had Margaret Mead studied the NASAns instead of the Samoans, this anthropological story of the shuttle catastrophe might have resulted. We see the bureaucratic culture that shaped the behavior of the rocket scientists: they launched <i>Challenger</i> expecting some damage to the now infamous O-rings. How they reached that position of tempting fate infuses Vaughan's account. Making arguable constructions about the engineering mentality and group-think, Vaughan focuses on the fateful teleconference the night before the launch, in which executives of the rocket manufacturer first resisted then caved into NASA's pressure to launch. For exerting that pressure, the space agency's managers were pilloried, but personalizing the blame, Vaughan believes, ignores the acculturated rules they followed--which emanated from the political and funding compromises that created the shuttle design. Though Vaughan's scholastic diction acts as narrative speed bumps, her sociological interpretation helps explain the seemingly inexplicable. This complements the dramatic and popular orientation of <i>No Downlink</i>, by Claus Jensen . <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>THINK Psychology</h2><p><p> <i>THINK Psychology</i> covers the essentials every introductory psychology student should know.

It explores the full range of theoretical approaches that drive social work treatment and knowledge development, from psychoanalysis to crisis intervention. <br><br>This treasure trove of practice knowledge equips professionals with a broad array of theoretical approaches, each of which shine a spotlight on a different aspect of the human condition. Emphasizing the importance of a broad-based theoretical approach to practice, it helps the reader avoid the pitfalls of becoming overly identified with a narrow focus that limits their understanding of clients and their contexts. <br><br>This sweeping overview of the field untangles the increasingly complex problems, ideologies, and value sets that define contemporary social work practice. The result is an essential A-to-Z reference that charts the full range of theoretical approaches available to social workers regardless of their setting or specialty.</p><p><br><strong>Dan Andreae</strong>, teaches at the University of Waterloo where he has received a prestigious Distinguished Teaching Award and at the University of Guelph Humber.

Each of the expertly written thirty-eight chapters provides a rich resource filled with theory-based explanations, and a framework for the subsequent concepts and strategies that lead to intervention success. In each of the approaches to practice, one unified message is heard throughout the chapter, clearly calling for an open and flexible approach to practice that takes into account all aspects of the person&#39;s internal and external environment. Solving problem behaviors is never simple and providing an interlocking framework that allows for choice in selecting theoretical perspectives opens the door to consistent, comprehensive, efficient, and effective service delivery. Sophia F. Dziegielewski, PhD, Professor, School of Social Work, University of Cincinnati This much-needed update to Turner&#39;s classic and comprehensive text on social work treatment theories includes nine new theories that have become influential in social work practice since the fourth edition published in 1996. It is essential that experienced practitioners as well as those new to the field be conversant with the theories and approaches that are shaping social work practice today. Turner&#39;s new edition, authored by recognized scholars and experienced clinicians, brings together all of the relevant social work treatment theories in today&#39;s postmodern world, making it easy for readers to become informed and to begin applying the theories in their practice.

Architecture is examined as a cultural phenomenon as well as an artistic and technological achievement. The book is divided into two parts: Part One, The Elements of Architecture,&#x201d; deals with the basic properties of architecture in chapters that explain function, structural principles, and elements of design, including examples in the text and illustrations from all periods and styles. Part Two, The History and Meaning of Architecture,&#x201d; is a chronological survey of Western architectural development from prehistoric times to the present. The approach is selective in terms of buildings and architects included; the examples are chosen for their importance and significance and are fully explained. Each chronological chapter begins with a concise, historical outline giving the social and cultural background. The illustrations (photographs, drawings, maps, and plans) are integrated with the text and there are notes, suggested readings, a glossary, chronological chart, and index.</p><p><b>Leland M. Roth</b> is Marion Dean Ross Professor of Architectural History at the University of Oregon at Eugene. He is the author of <i>American Architecture: A History</i> ; <i>A Concise History of American Architecture</i> ; <i>McKim, Mead &amp; White, Architects</i> ; and other works. He lives in Eugene, Oregon.This lively survey by the author of A Concise History of Architecture ( LJ 7/79) examines architecture as a cultural phenomenon as well as an artistic and technological achievement. Roth (architecture, Univ. of Oregon) argues that architecture does more than provide shelter; it is also a physical expression of how people view themselves in relation to each other and to the universe. Part 1 provides a solid introduction to the discipline's form and function; Part 2 focuses on the major buildings, styles, and architects from prehistoric times to the present, with a valuable historical overview opening each chapter. Non-Western and vernacular architecture are mentioned only in passing, the one small shortcoming in an otherwise readable and lucid book. Highly recommended.<br><i>- H.

Now after twenty-one years and with many other books on the market, it has become the most widely-used and recommended book on stretching and its popularity continues to grow each year. The reasons for this may be the book's simple, user-friendly organization, the easy to follow individual stretches and principles, the ample line drawings by Jean Anderson, and the need for every body to stretch.</p><p>Anderson started running and cycling during the salad days of the fitness boom, when the goal was simply to go farther and farther. No one knew what all those miles would do for a body--or do <i>to</i> a body. One day he realized he could barely reach past his knees while sitting on the floor in a straight-legged position. His tight muscles thus revealed, he began a lifelong quest to figure out the secrets of flexibility.<p> His main discovery--and his core message to readers--is this: "Stretching feels good when done correctly," he writes. "You do not have to push limits or attempt to go further each day. It should not be a personal contest to see how far you can stretch."</p><p> The world of sports may have shifted away from Anderson's style of "static" stretching--holding a stretch for 20 to 30 seconds or longer--but in the everyday world, it's still considered the safest and easiest way for people to become more flexible.</p><p> The key to successful stretching, Anderson says, is not trying to do too much. "It's better to understretch than overstretch," he writes. The point of flexibility exercise, after all, is to protect yourself from injury or immobility. The worst thing you can do is hurt and ultimately immobilize yourself while trying to prevent those consequences.</p><p> <i>Stretching</i> contains hundreds of exercises, simply and clearly drawn by Jean Anderson, the author's wife. (In an eccentric twist, most of the figures in the drawings are shown wearing wool hats, which Mrs. Anderson designs and sells.) Routines are shown for getting up in the morning, for before and after walking or sitting, and for watching TV. Sport-specific routines include programs for weight training, basketball, golf, running, and many others. All are simple, safe, and as easy as you're willing to let them be. <i>--Lou Schuler</i></p>Stretching is the vital link between the sedentary life and the active life. Stretching helps reverse the &#34;creeping rigor mortis&#34; of getting older.</p><h2>The Salem Witch Hunt: A Brief History with Documents</h2><p>The Salem witch trials stand as one of the infamous moments in colonial American history. More than 150 people -- primarily women -- from 24 communities were charged with witchcraft; 19 were hanged and others died in prison. In his introduction to this compact yet comprehensive volume, Richard Godbeer explores the beliefs, fears, and historical context that fueled the witch panic of 1692. The documents in this collection illuminate how the Puritans&#39; worldview led them to seek a supernatural explanation for the problems vexing their community. Presented as case studies, the carefully chosen records from several specific trials offer a clear picture of the gender norms and social tensions that underlie the witchcraft accusations. The final documents cover recantations of confessions, the aftermath of the witch hunt, and statements of regret. A chronology of the witchcraft crisis, questions for consideration, and a selected bibliography round out the book&#39;s pedagogical support.</p><p><b>RICHARD GODBEER</b> (Ph.D., Brandeis University) is professor of history at the University of Miami. Godbeer's research and teaching interests center on colonial and revolutionary America, with an emphasis on religious culture, gender studies, and the history of sexuality. His first book, <i>The Devil's Dominion: Magic and Religion in Early New England</i> (1992) won the American Historical Association Pacific Coast Branch Award for the Best First Book. He is also the author of <i>Sexual Revolution in Early America</i> (2002), <i>Escaping Salem: The Other Witch Hunt of 1692</i> (2004), and <i>The Overflowing of Friendship: Love Between Men and the Creation of the American Republic</i> (2009).</p><h2>Great Expectations (Everyman&#39;s Library)</h2><p><p>One of Charles Dickens&#x2019;s most fascinating novels, <i>Great Expectations</i> follows the orphan Pip as he leaves behind a childhood of misery and poverty after an anonymous benefactor offers him a chance at the life of a gentleman. <br><br>From the young Pip&#x2019;s first terrifying encounter with the convict Magwitch in the gloom of a graveyard to the splendidly morbid set pieces in Miss Havisham&#x2019;s mansion to the magnificently realized boat chase down the Thames, <i>Great Expectations</i> is filled with the transcendent excitement that Dickens could so abundantly provide. <br><br>Written in 1860, at the height of his maturity, it also reveals the novelist&#x2019;s bittersweet understanding of the extent to which our deepest moral dilemmas are born of our own obsessions and illusions.<br><br>This edition includes Dickens&#x2019;s original, discarded conclusion to the novel, the 1907 Everyman preface by G. K. Chesterton, and twenty illustrations by F. W. Pailthorpe.<br></p></p><p>An absorbing mystery as well as a morality tale, the story of Pip, a poor village lad, and his expectations of wealth is Dickens at his most deliciously readable. The cast of characters includes kindly Joe Gargery, the loyal convict Abel Magwitch and the haunting Miss Havisham. If you have heartstrings, count on them being tugged.The first book edition of Great Expectations was published in three volumes in 1861. It is now reissued simultaneously with the serialised version of 1860-1 and a newly photographed colour reproduction of the original manuscript, enabling scholars and enthusiasts to study the book version alongside the work-in-progress.</p><h2>A Ride on the Red Mare&#39;s Back</h2><p>With the aid of her magic wooden horse, a brave girl travels to the High House in the mountains to rescue her kidnapped brother from the trolls</p><p>Julie Downing is an internationally published author and illustrator. She has illustrated over thirty highly acclaimed books for children. Her work has been exhibited in galleries throughout the United States and England. She lives in San Francisco, California.Grade 1-5-- Le Guin's unnamed heroine is neither flamboyant nor elegant, but she is focused and wonderfully resolute. The tale tells of a little boy stolen by wicked trolls and taken to their High House. Since the heartbroken father is unable to cope and the mother must stay home with the baby, the sister sets out with a bit of bread, knitting needles, red yarn, and a scarf to find her brother. Of course, she is accompanied by her magical red wooden horse that her father had carved. Using traditional folkloric patterns, Le Guin fashions a child protagonist who is not overly frightened by trolls; she just deals with them. She is not even overly impressed with the mare who is her guide and champion. The horse does her thing and the girl goes on with her rescue mission. The language is rhythmic, with well-paced cadences and a tone that calls out to be read aloud. The illustrations do not invade the space of this well-crafted tale, but provide glimpses of what is being shared. Text pages have a decorative gray border that seems to embrace the words and adds a measure of caring to the telling. On the other pages, Downing uses the lovely reds of the horse and the scarf against more sober colors to complete the images. This story is a real gem that demonstrates the value of determination and that one's sense of satisfaction in a task completed is reward enough. Bravo to such a creative work. --Kay E.

In Bern, she attended the Freies Gymnasium and spoke not only fluent French and German but also English, which was the language spoken to her by her American parents. After World War II, Dr. McCuen-Metherell's parents sent her and her brother to Pacific Union College (in California's Napa Valley), where she received a B. A. in English. She taught English and French in high school for several years and then took night classes at the University of Southern California, where she earned an M.A. and Ph.D. While working on her doctorate, she was hired to teach English at Glendale Community College and later to serve as Dean of the Evening College. A chance meeting in 1973 with Anthony C. Winkler, a successful novelist, led to a literary partnership that has produced 15 coauthored textbooks used at colleges and universities across the United States.<br><br>Born in Kingston, Jamaica West Indies, Anthony C. Winkler was educated in Jamaica at Excelsior College, Mount Alvernia Academy and Cornwall College, the last two being in Montego Bay. He was also educated at Citrus Community College, Glendora, California. Winkler taught briefly at Pasadena City College and for a year at Moneague Teachers College in Saint Anne, Jamaica, an experience chronicled in GOING HOME TO TEACH (1995). From 1968 to 1975 Winkler had sales territories as a bookman for Appleton Century Crofts textbook publishers, and later for Scott, Foresman. In 1969 he decided he could write textbooks as well as anyone. Through a chance meeting with the sales representative of another company, he submitted the manuscript POETRY AS SYSTEM and was offered a contract for its publication. Eventually, he met Jo Ray McCuen-Metherell and the two became textbook writers and collaborators. Over the years they have produced more than a dozen textbooks, most on rhetoric and writing. In addition to Winkler's textbooks, his body of work includes, among other books: THE PAINTED CANOE (novel, 1983); THE LUNATIC (novel, 1987); THE GREAT YACHT RACE (novel, 1992); DOG WAR (novel, 2006); TRUST THE DARKNESS: MY LIFE AS A WRITER (autobiography, 2008); THE BURGLARY (play, premiered in Toronto in 2005); THE LUNATIC (movie, filmed in 1991); THE ANNIHILATION OF FISH (movie, 1999); and BOB MARLEY, AN INTIMATE PORTRAIT BY HIS MOTHER (biography, 1996, with Cedella Booker)."The students enjoy the writing exercises associated with the photos, and they appreciate having clear explanations of the essay structure, the rhetorical modes and the sample MLA paper."<br><br>"I haven't found any other text that nails the rewriting process so well."<br><br>"The chapter is very successful in breaking down the process of incorporating sources.

Cancer screening is evaluated (along with most other areas of medical research) through trials that use a particular array of statistical methods to assess the effectiveness of the screening process. This book is an edited collection of chapters written by the world authorities in this area demonstrating practical ways that researchers can use to help them evaluate their own screening procedures. It describes the context and development of cancer screening and its evaluations, and the modelling approaches used to evaluate cancer screening, and goes on the discuss the principles of monitoring service screening. The final part of the book presents case studies and problem solving scenarios to illustrate the foregoing discussion.</p><p>Cancer screening programmes have become routine practice throughout the developed world &#x2013; aiming to detect the presence of the disease prior to the manifestation of symptoms, and to increase the likelihood of successful treatment. Naturally, these programmes require regular monitoring to ensure that screening quality is maintained, and to advance the early-warning system as much as possible. Quantitative Methods for the Evaluation of Cancer Screening is a professional title designed to provide the researchers of these screening programmes with up-to-date methods and tools for improving evaluation. The book presents an introduction to cancer screening and to the methods that are employed for its monitoring, followed by an in-depth account of the more complicated modelling approaches. Each chapter is written by an international expert in the field, and imparts practical specialist information that the reader can apply to the evaluation of their own programmes. Case studies illustrate the methods in practice and provide further illumination of the fields of breast, cervix, large bowel, and neuroblastoma screening.<br><b>Stephen W.

It is a fundamental element in the entire body of Orthodox Tradition. In this two-volume work, Leonid Ouspensky provides the reader with a deep and serious approach to the mystery of the sacred image. He surveys the development of the sacred art of the Christian East from its beginnings in catacomb art through the iconoclastic controversy of the eighth and ninth century. Drawing especially on the Russian Orthodox tradition, the author studies a large number of texts with care and in great detail. He includes an analysis of the flowering of early Russian iconography, tracing its later development and the state of the art today. The 51 black and white photo illustrations, along with the four-panel foldout and six color plates, will enable the reader to appreciate the Orthodox icon with an informed mind and open heart. This is the most comprehensive introduction available to the history and theology of the icon, and is the standard text upon which most modern studies of iconography are based. Volume I, originally published in 1978, has been updated by the author and contains large sections of new material.</p><p>Leonid Ouspensky, one of the most influential iconographers and iconologists of this century, lived in Paris, France, until his death in 1987.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>Walden and Civil Disobedience (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p><i>Walden and Civil Disobedience</i>, by <b>Henry David Thoreau</b>, is part of the <i><i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Over a 60-year career, he designed more than 2,000 gardens worldwide, the most famous of which are those he created in collaboration with the architect Oscar Niemeyer for Bras�lia. Although he is best known for his landscape work, Burle Marx was a prolific artist in a variety of media, and his larger body of work&#x2014;which includes paintings, drawings, tile mosaics, sculpture, textile design, jewelry, theater costumes, and more&#x2014;is critical to understanding his importance as a modernist. An avid horticulturalist, he was among the first to denounce deforestation in the Amazon region; he also discovered over thirty species of Brazilian flora, which bear his name.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This beautifully illustrated and groundbreaking publication covers the full range of Burle Marx&#x2019;s artistic output, as well as his remarkable home, an abandoned estate that he transformed into his office, workshop, gallery, and living space. The enduring influence of Burle Marx&#x2019;s work is also explored through interviews with seven contemporary artists: Juan Araujo, Paloma Bosqu�, Dominique Gonz�lez-Foerster, Luisa Lambri, Arto Lindsay, Nick Mauss, and Beatriz Milhazes. These artists exemplify the extent to which his work continues to be a source of inspiration.</p><p>The full range and enduring influence of Brazilian modernist landscape architect and garden designer Roberto Burle Marx&#x2019;s groundbreaking artistic output is explored in this landmark publication.<br><b>Jens Hoffmann </b>is deputy director of exhibitions and public programs and <b>Claudia J.

Relentless and incantatory, these poems are charged with an almost religious intensity as Seuss looks for God's presence in nature and sexuality. Again and again the poet confronts whatever it is that guides us through a life that is sensuous, yet exacting in its terrible cost. Nothing is solved by the end of this book, but much is gained as the quest itself has become a victory of perfectly pitched and furious language. God's still hidden away, but by now the natural world has evolved to replace the absence Seuss feels. In the book's erotically charged universe, one paradoxically begins to feel a calm settle over the burned-up panorama of the soul. It Blows You Hollow is a book, rare these days, that feels as if it had to be written.

For me, the God poems offer a search, a wrestling as bold and intense as any since G. M. Hopkins. Each poem has its own voice-cajoling, taunting, despairing-but each calls out for some lively presence in the world: "I want a direct God-hit, no shrapnel. In other words, love, I walk this dark minefield searching for you." -- <i>Conrad Hilberry</i><br><br>It Blows You Hollow is Seuss-Brakeman's chronicle of edgy memories, private sorrows, charged darkness; of scarcities, plenitude and dangers. These sensual and irreverent poems erupt with unexpected turns of language at once elegant and fierce. Reading them made the back hairs of my neck bristle in recognition that real poetry is going on here. Hers is a gift of metaphoric daring and wit that dazzles and consoles with lan, vital and probing truth. -- <i>Colette Inez</i></p><h2>Basic Engineering Data Collection and Analysis</h2><p>Stephen Vardeman and J. Marcus Jobe&#39;s motivating new book is appropriate for students in introductory engineering statistics courses, including chemical, mechanical, environmental, civil, electrical, and industrial.

The American Sign Language Handshape Dictionary can help users locate a sign whose meaning they have forgotten, or help them find the meaning of a new sign they have just seen for the first time. Instead of offering a conventional alphabetical arrangement of English words and their corresponding signs, The ASL Handshape Dictionary organizes more than 1,600 ASL signs by 40 basic handshapes and includes detailed descriptions on how to form each sign.<br>In easy-to-follow style, The ASL Handshape Dictionary explains how signs are used in ASL structure and presents clear, explicit directions on how to identify a sign and its meaning in the specific context of its use.<br>A complete English word index provides the option of referring to an alphabetical listing of English terms to locate an equivalent sign or choice of signs.</p><p>Richard A. Tennant is a former mathematics teacher who has studied American Sign Language extensively; he resides in Acra, NY.<br>Marianne Glussak Brown is an American Sign Language Teacher's Association (ASLTA) professionally certified interpreter and a child of deaf parents (coda) who works in Palisades, NY.This reference complements other American Sign Language (ASL) dictionaries by organizing signs by handshape rather than alphabetically by English word order. In so doing, it acts best as a recognition tool for the ASL learner, leading the user quickly to specific signs without having first to refer to an English-equivalent word. Multiple meanings of a single sign also allow deaf people to increase their English vocabulary. Like other ASL dictionaries, introductory material includes a brief synopsis of the history of sign language, the meaning and importance of the five parameters of a sign (handshape, orientation, location, movement, and nonmanual signals), grammatical rules, sign language variations (dialects), and finger-spelling principles. Tennant, a former mathematics instructor, and Gluszak Brown, a certified ASL interpreter, have provided a unique organization in their dictionary. But readers should note that a handshape is not a sign itself but rather a characteristic of a particular sign. Each individual sign presented in this dictionary is illustrated, paired with English-equivalent meaning(s), and described in terms of the five parameters, making it useful as a teaching reference as well as a recognition tool.

The Mirror Bible is a paraphrase from the original Greek text. While the detailed shades of meaning of every Greek word have been closely studied, this is done taking into account the consistent context of the entire chapter within the wider epistle, and bearing in mind the full context of Jesus as the revealer and redeemer of the image and likeness of the invisible God in human form, which is what the message of the Bible is all about. To assist the reader in their study, I have numerically superscripted the Greek word and corresponded it with the closest English word in the italicized commentary that follows. This is to create a direct comparison of words between the two languages. Many words used in previous translations have adopted meanings in time that distract from the original thought. Individual words can greatly influence the interpretation of any conversation. For years deliberate as well as oblivious errors in translations were repeated and have empowered the religious institutions of the day to influence, manipulate and even abuse masses of people. Consider the word metanoia, consisting of two components, meta, together with, and nous, mind, suggesting a radical mind shift. This word has always been translated as "repentance," which is an old English word borrowed from the Latin word, penance. Then they added the "re" to get even more mileage out of sin consciousness. Re-penance. This gross deception led to the perverted doctrines of indulgences, where naive, ignorant people were led to believe that they needed to purchase favor from an angry god. Most cathedrals as well as many ministries were funded with guilt money. The Bible is a dangerous book! It has confused and divided more people than any other document. Scriptures have been used to justify some of the greatest atrocities in human history. People were tortured, burned to death and multitudes murdered based on somebody's understanding of the scriptures! Jesus, Paul and believers throughout the ages faced their greatest opposition from those who knew the scriptures. If it is such a dangerous document, how does one approach the book? The Mirror unveils the Incarnation Code as the key that unlocks the mystery message of scripture. The romance of the ages is revealed here.</p></p><p>Lydia and Francois met on the 25th of August 1974, while he was working with Youth For Christ. She was sixteen and he nineteen. The following year he studied Greek and Hebrew at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, for three years while Lydia completed her nursing training. In 1978 Francois also spent a year with Youth with a Mission. They married in January 1979 and are blessed with four amazing children, Renaldo, Tehilla, Christo and Stefan; also, two darling grandchildren Nicola and Christiaan. They worked in a full-time mission for fourteen years, during which time they also pastored a church and led a training facility for more than 700 students over a five-year period. They then left the ministry and for ten years did business mainly in the tourism industry. They built and managed a Safari Lodge in the Sabi Sand Game Reserve and eventually relocated to Hermanus where they started Southern Right Charters boat-based whale watching. In December 2000 Francois began to write the book, &#34;God believes in You&#34; which led to him being invited to speak at various Christian camps and churches. Since February 2004, they travelled regularly abroad and into Africa as well as South Africa. Francois has written several books in both English and Afrikaans, including God Believes in You, Divine Embrace, The Logic of His Love and The Eagle Story; these are also available on Kindle. Also Kant En Klaar [Done!] In order to focus their time on writing and translation, they relocated from Hermanus in 2015 to a remote farm in the Swartberg Mountains. They have also stopped most of their travelling. Lydia already wrote 5 amazing children&#39;s stories of which one, Stella&#39;s Secret is already published in print and on Kindle. Francois continues to be passionately engaged in his translation of the Mirror Bible, which will eventually include the entire NT as well as select portions of the old. The 1st 200 page Edition was published in 2012. The most recent 8th edition Mirror Bible is now almost 800 pages of bliss! This will also be available in a special hardcover edition. Until the completion of the New Testament, future editions will only be added as separate books as well as a 3-Volume edition Mirror Bible. The current 8th edition will still be available as a one volume book. Some of his work is being translated into several African languages as well as Chinese, Russian, Hungarian, German, French, Polish, Portuguese, Dutch and Slovakian. The Mirror Bible is already up to date in Spanish, Shona and Xhosa and large portions in German. Thousands of people subscribe to their daily posts on Social Media; Lydia has her own fb page and Francois has 5 English pages on Facebook. You can get more detail about them on www.mirrorword.net.

Over nine tumultuous days in October, the House Un-American Activities Committee held a notorious round of hearings into alleged Communist subversion in the movie industry. The blowback was profound: the major studios pledged to never again employ a known Communist or unrepentant fellow traveler. The declaration marked the onset of the blacklist era, a time when political allegiances, real or suspected, determined employment opportunities in the entertainment industry. Hundreds of artists were shown the door&#x2015;or had it shut in their faces.<br><br>In <i>Show Trial, </i>Thomas Doherty takes us behind the scenes at the first full-on media-political spectacle of the postwar era. He details the theatrical elements of a proceeding that bridged the realms of entertainment and politics, a courtroom drama starring glamorous actors, colorful moguls, on-the-make congressmen, high-priced lawyers, single-minded investigators, and recalcitrant screenwriters, all recorded by newsreel cameras and broadcast over radio. Doherty tells the story of the Hollywood Ten and the other witnesses, friendly and unfriendly, who testified, and chronicles the implementation of the postwar blacklist. <i>Show Trial </i>is a rich, character-driven inquiry into how the HUAC hearings ignited the anti-Communist crackdown in Hollywood, providing a gripping cultural history of one of the most transformative events of the postwar era.</p><p>Thomas Doherty is professor of American studies at Brandeis University. His previous Columbia University Press books include <i>Pre-Code Hollywood: Sex, Immorality, and Insurrection in American Cinema, 1930&#x2013;1934 </i>(1999); <i>Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture</i> (2003); <i>Hollywood&#x2019;s Censor: Joseph I.

(J. Hoberman, author of <i>An Army of Phantoms: American Movies and the Making of the Cold War</i>)<br><br>Thomas Doherty&#x2019;s <i>Show Trial</i> is a uniquely pragmatic history of the Hollywood Blacklist&#x2015;a big book on a big topic that ruthlessly defies and confounds orthodoxy at every turn. No book in print provides a fuller accounting of the hearings themselves. And no author to date gives his readers so much room to appreciate and understand who said what and why. (Jon Lewis, author of <i>Hard-Boiled Hollywood: Crime and Punishment in Postwar Los Angeles</i>)<br><br>Doherty is one of the best, if not <i>the</i> best, writers in the American studies world today, and has produced an excellent book that will command a great deal of attention. <i>Show Trial </i>sheds new light on the story of the Hollywood Ten and HUAC and does it in fresh and exciting ways. One of the book&#x2019;s greatest strengths is that it stays away from familiar academic debates that focus heavily on politics and instead tells a character-driven story using quotes from a wide variety of contemporaneous participants. Doherty places the personalities of the era&#x2015;left and right&#x2015;on center stage. This is easily the most comprehensive and comprehensible study of HUAC and the Hollywood Ten to date, and I predict it will become the book to read on this topic. (Steven Ross, author of <i>Hitler in Los Angeles: How Jews Foiled Nazi Plots Against Hollywood and America</i>)<br><br>Illuminating. . . . With accessible prose and astute academic insight, Doherty shows us that both the studios and the Hollywood Ten were victims of HUAC.

It is impossible to read <i>Show Trial</i> without thinking about its relevance to the current situation in America. The country is again faced with a resurgence of nativism, racism and isolationism (ironically, it is now progressives who are warning about nefarious Russian influence) and a culture of believing figures in the public eye to be guilty until proven innocent. One can only hope for another pendulum swing, such as the one Thomas Doherty, in this engaging study, demonstrates happened over the Hollywood blacklist.

Chief of the Nazi Criminal Police, the SS Security Service, and the Gestapo, ruthless overlord of Nazi-occupied Bohemia and Moravia, and leading planner of the "Final Solution," Heydrich played a central role in Hitler's Germany. He shouldered a major share of responsibility for some of the worst Nazi atrocities, and up to his assassination in Prague in 1942, he was widely seen as one of the most dangerous men in Nazi Germany. Yet Heydrich has received remarkably modest attention in the extensive literature of the Third Reich.</p><p>Robert Gerwarth weaves together little-known stories of Heydrich's private life with his deeds as head of the Nazi Reich Security Main Office. Fully exploring Heydrich's progression from a privileged middle-class youth to a rapacious mass murderer, Gerwarth sheds new light on the complexity of Heydrich's adult character, his motivations, the incremental steps that led to unimaginable atrocities, and the consequences of his murderous efforts toward re-creating the entire ethnic makeup of Europe.</p></p><p><b>Robert Gerwarth</b> is professor of modern history at University College Dublin and director of UCD&#x2019;s Centre for War Studies."This admirable biography makes plausible what actually happened and makes human what we might prefer to dismiss as monstrous."&#x2014;Timothy Snyder, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br>"Supremely enlightening."&#x2014;Jacob Heilbrunn, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br>"Gerwarth&#x2019;s approach is subtle, painstaking and psychologically acute; it convincingly demonstrates that the historian&#x2019;s tool of 'cold empathy' best clarifies the enduring question of what brings forth monsters."&#x2014;Roy Foster, <i>Times Literary Supplement (Books of the Year)</i><br>"<i>Hitler&#x2019;s Hangman: The Life of Heydrich</i> by Robert Gerwarth is superb on the making of evil."&#x2014;Frank Dikotter, <i>The Daily Telegraph (Books of the Year)</i><br>"At the subsequent grand public funeral, Nazi leaders eulogized Heydrich as the perfect Nazi.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Much to its author's chagrin, <i>The Golden Notebook</i> instantly became a staple of the feminist movement when it was published in 1962. Doris Lessing's novel deconstructs the life of Anna Wulf, a sometime-Communist and a deeply leftist writer living in postwar London with her small daughter. Anna is battling writer's block, and, it often seems, the damaging chaos of life itself. The elements that made the book remarkable when it first appeared--extremely candid sexual and psychological descriptions of its characters and a fractured, postmodern structure--are no longer shocking. Nevertheless, <i>The Golden Notebook</i> has retained a great deal of power, chiefly due to its often brutal honesty and the sheer variation and sweep of its prose.<p> This largely autobiographical work comprises Anna's four notebooks: "a black notebook which is to do with Anna Wulf the writer; a red notebook concerned with politics; a yellow notebook, in which I make stories out of my experience; and a blue notebook which tries to be a diary." In a brilliant act of verisimilitude, Lessing alternates between these notebooks instead of presenting each one whole, also weaving in a novel called <i>Free Women</i>, which views Anna's life from the omniscient narrator's point of view. As the novel draws to a close, Anna, in the midst of a breakdown, abandons her dependence on compartmentalization and writes the single golden notebook of the title.</p><p> In tracking Anna's psychological movements--her recollections of her years in Africa, her relationship with her best friend, Molly, her travails with men, her disillusionment with the Party, the tidal pull of motherhood--Lessing pinpoints the pulse of a generation of women who were waiting to see what their postwar hopes would bring them. What arrived was unprecedented freedom, but with that freedom came unprecedented confusion. Lessing herself said in a 1994 interview: "I say fiction is better than telling the truth. Because the point about life is that it's a mess, isn't it? It hasn't got any shape except for you're born and you die." </p><p> <i>The Golden Notebook</i> suffers from certain weaknesses, among them giving rather simplistic, overblown illustrations to the phrase "a good man is hard to find" in the form of an endless parade of weak, selfish men. But it still has the capacity to fill emotional voids with the great rushes of feeling it details. Perhaps this is because it embodies one of Anna's own revelations: "I've been forced to acknowledge that the flashes of genuine art are all out of deep, suddenly stark, undisguiseable private emotion. Even in translation there is no mistaking these lightning flashes of genuine personal feeling." It seems that Lessing, like Anna when she decides to abandon her notebooks for the single, golden one, attempted to put all of herself in one book. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>doris lessing is widely recognized as one of the greatest writers of the second half of the twentieth century.</p><h2>Best Business Practices for Photographers, Third Edition</h2><p>The photography industry is advancing and changing more&#x2014;and more quickly&#x2014;than ever.

From almonds and apples to tea and rice, many foods that we consume today have histories that can be traced out of prehistoric Central Asia along the tracks of the Silk Road to kitchens in Europe, America, China, and elsewhere in East Asia. The exchange of goods, ideas, cultural practices, and genes along these ancient routes extends back five thousand years, and organized trade along the Silk Road dates to at least Han Dynasty China in the second century BC. Balancing a broad array of archaeological, botanical, and historical evidence,&nbsp;<i>Fruit from the Sands&nbsp;</i>presents the fascinating story of the origins and spread of agriculture across Inner Asia and into Europe and East Asia. Through the preserved remains of plants found in archaeological sites, Robert N. Spengler III identifies the regions where our most familiar crops were domesticated and follows their routes as people carried them around the world. With vivid examples,&nbsp;<i>Fruit from the Sands&nbsp;</i>explores how the foods we eat have shaped the course of human history and transformed cuisines all over the globe.</p><p>&#x201c;Few scholars would have the chutzpah to write such a bold book. Robert Spengler presents an exemplary case of work that is not only rigorous but broadly accessible and truly interdisciplinary in scope.&nbsp;<i>Fruit from the Sands</i> reveals that the large-scale biological exchange epitomized by the Columbian Exchange had an ancient precursor, one previously unappreciated but equally crucial for the human diet. This book will change the way that readers see their food.&#x201d;&#x2014;Miranda Brown, Professor of Asian Languages and Cultures, University of Michigan<br><br> &#x201c;To an archaeobotanist, the food on your table encodes the very history of humankind.

Millward,&nbsp;Professor of Intersocietal History at the Edmund Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University<br> &#x201c;Spengler takes the reader on a kaleidoscopic and dazzling journey: from the rice paddies of southern China, the stands of melon vendors at the bazaars in Samarkand, and the archaeological excavations in remote mountain regions of present-day Kazakhstan to the reader's own kitchen table. This book is a must-read for anyone interested in Silk Road exchanges.&#x201d;&#x2014;S�ren Stark, Associate Professor of Central Asian Archaeology, Institute for the Study of the Ancient World/NYU&nbsp;<b>Robert N.

While its collapse is tangible, the outcome of such a collapse remains a matter of speculation and public debate. The US is desperately seeking to preserve the status quo, which rests primarily upon recognition of its military supremacy.<br><br>For millennia, warfare has been a driving force behind changes in the geopolitical status of power configurations (whether of peoples, states or empires), and it remains so, today. Accordingly, short of actual warfare, the assessment (modeling) of relative military power plays an inordinate role in the determination of national status. <br><br>Models of emerging changes in military capability range from relatively simple to extremely complex ones. Viewing the evolution of the current system of international relations outside the framework of actual, rather than propaganda-driven, military capabilities is not only useless, it is dangerous since states&#x2019; mistaken assessment of their own and other states&#x2019; military power can lead to misadventures and catastrophic mistakes. <br><br>The United States&#x2019; efforts to preserve not just its dominance but the perception of its dominance are bound to fail for many important reasons, none more important than what is often misidentified in past American military-theoretical hypotheses about the future of warfare, known generically as the Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA). This book explains why those hypotheses are failing and will continue to fail, and addresses the real RMA.<br><br>In the end, technological development in weaponry as a response to tactical, operational and strategic requirements defines not only a nation's geopolitical status but determines the global order. Assessments of military capacity, if reality-based, serve as good predictors of the level of volatility in international relations and the level of violence globally. <br><br>This book gives an insight into the evolution of weapons and the way they influenced international relations in the 20th and 21st centuries. It also defines Revolution in Military Affairs as manifested via policy, politics, and technology. It reviews some models which are useful in assessing the current geopolitical situation. This book also tries to give a forecast of the future development of warfare and the ways in which it is going to change the whole system of international relations, hopefully towards a new geopolitical equilibrium.</p><p>Andrei Martyanov is an expert on Russian military and naval issues.

These form a ballast for what goes on to become military aggression, easily resorted to because of the often complete inability to understand the practice (what really happens during warfare) and the consequences of the application of military power (trauma and destruction) and accordingly an appreciation of how to achieve a global military balance precluding war. This is not to say that liberal academe doesn&#x2019;t try to understand this&#x2015;it tries repeatedly, including by creating a variety of models and theories of international relations and of wars, but too many of those theories are nothing more than white board abstracts. It warrants noting that for all its aggressiveness, globalism&#x2019;s main driver, the United States, produced a rather mediocre record of military accomplishments, while providing a cornucopia of theories on how to win wars and what is military balance. Many theories have come and gone trying to explain how war and international relations interact, be that Stephen Biddle&#x2019;s &#x201c;New System,&#x201d; or Foreign Policy Realism in its mind boggling variety from Structural to Offensive to Defensive theories, or even Offense-Defense Theory.<br><br>Few of those, however, answer the question as to what military power and balance really are, what is their nature and what is their role in the fight for survival. That brings forth a hugely important moral issue of who is the victim and who is the predator in a dyadic relation of nations. Without addressing this question, no amount of Offense-Defense or any other reasoning will help in understanding the process of the formation of military power and balance in the modern world. In other words, it matters a great deal why a nation builds its own military power and what it intends to use it for. The answer defines a key condition for a good life for the potential victim&#x2015;survival, preservation of life, that is, or in other words an ability to live in peace thanks to the strength of arms. There is no good life without peace and liberalism is not capable of defining that as a key component of a good life, due to liberalism and its scholarship living in a complete delusion about the predatory intentions driving its own economic and often grossly exaggerated military capability.</p><h2>From Abacus to Zeus: A Handbook of Art History</h2><p>For freshman and sophomore courses in Art History Survey (1 or 2 semesters) and Introduction to Art. Designed as a comprehensive supplement to Janson&#39;s History of Art, Sixth Edition, Hartt&#39;s Art, Fourth Edition, Gardner&#39;s Art Through the Ages, Eleventh Edition, and Stokstad&#39;s Art History (Revised) - but also appropriate as a stand-alone brief reference text - this handbook defines the most common terms used in discussing the history of visual arts, relating them to specific works illustrated in these standard texts.</p><p>Designed as a comprehensive supplement to Janson&#39;s History of Art, Fifth Edition, Hartt&#39;s Art, Fourth Edition, and Gardner&#39;s Art Through the Ages, Ninth Edition -- but also appropriate as a stand-alone brief reference text -- this handbook defines the most common terms used in discussing the history of visual arts.Preface <p> ART must ultimately be explained in terms of art, not art terms. The description of visual form, the definition of stylistic categories, and the decoding of ancient myth and symbol, while fascinating pursuits in their own right, are of greatest value when they are mastered with the aim of comprehending the unique expressive power of individual works of art. This handbook has been prepared with that end in mind. Terminology and iconography have been defined with reference to specific works of art. This is done by keying entries to the splendid collection of over 1,200 reproductions in the sixth edition of H.W and A.F Janson's popular and accessible History of Art. Thus, terms, processes, principles, subjects, and symbols are not only defined verbally but can be studied as they appear in particular contexts and in historical sequence. </p><p> For those who may have Marilyn Stokstad's Art History (revised edition), the fourth edition of Frederick Hartt's Art or the eleventh edition of Fred S. Kleiner and Christin J. Mamiya, Gardner's Art through the Ages, a list of identical or similar illustrations in these art history surveys, paralleling those in the sixth edition of Janson's History o f Art, is provided at the very back of this book. By consulting this table of parallel illustrations, most of the Janson figure numbers referred to in the entries in this book can also be located in current editions of Stokstad, Hartt and Gardner. </p><p> The numbers in italics found in the various entries (e.g. 19-25) refer to figure numbers in the sixth edition of Janson's History o f Art; numbers preceded by "fig." refer to the illustrations in this book. Words in italics are cross-references to other entries. If a term is printed in italics, a definition of it will be found in alphabetical order in Chapter One; mythological beings will be found in Chapter Two; the subjects of Christian art, arranged by category, will be found in Chapter Three; saints, in Chapter Four; and Christian signs and symbols, in Chapter Five. </p><p> Following Chapter Five is a chronological list of leading painters, photographers, sculptors, and architects from the fourteenth century to the present. Entries indicate birth and death dates, nationality, customary media employed and places where the artist is known to have worked. An especially useful feature of this list is the simplified phonetic indication of the common pronunciation of the artist's name. Following the Chronology are maps locating art centers commonly mentioned in surveys of art history. Keys to the vast storehouse of digital imagery now available on the internet have been provided in the Directory of Museum Websites preceding the Index. The comprehensive Index not only alphabetically lists all entries from the five chapters but also includes the hundreds of terms defined within the major entries. </p><p> Simplified phonetic pronunciations are provided for unfamiliar names and terms, but they are only approximations of polite usage, introduced to prevent only the most ear-shattering barbarisms. In many cases, other pronunciations are equally acceptable. When a word has been taken over directly from a foreign language, it may usually be given the proper foreign pronunciation without raising too many eyebrows. Thus, "tablinum" (tably'num) may even more "correctly" be pronounced ta-blee'num. In Chapter Four, the English names of saints are followed by their customary Italian, French, Spanish, and German names when the foreign form is markedly different from the English. An explanation of symbols, indicating French and German sounds not used in English, will be found preceding the chronological list of artists. </p><p> I am particularly indebted to Paulette Perone, who helped prepare the original list of entries; Arthur Irwin, who made many of the original architectural drawings; Catherine Hartkopf, who typed the original manuscript; the late H.W: Janson, who kindly consented to read the original manuscript and gave me the benefit of his wise counsel; and all those students at Case-Western Reserve University, the University of Kentucky, Dartmouth College, and Colby College, who, over the years, insisted that I define my terms.</p><p>J.S.P.</p></p><h2>Great Source Daybooks: Softcover Student Edition Grade 9 Literature Inc. 1998</h2><p>- Point-of-use lesson plans with step-by-step instructional support- Differentiated instruction strategies to meet the needs of all students- Coverage of the five essential acts of reading --key strategies for strengthening literacy skills- Vocabulary support for each selection- Detailed guidelines for assessing students&#39; progress</p><p></p><h2>Devil&#39;s Cub (Historical Romances, 8)</h2><p><p><em>Devil's Cub is one of Georgette Heyer's most famous and memorable novels, featuring a dashing and wild young nobleman and the gently bred young lady in whom he finally meets his match?</em></p><p><strong>Like father, like son?</strong><br>Dominic Alistair, Marquis of Vidal and fiery son of the notorious Duke of Avon, has established a rakish reputation that rivals his father's, living a life of excess and indulgence.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. It is known that she was born in Wimbledon in August 1902, and her first novel, The Black Moth, was published in 1921. <br><br>Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Heyer's large volume of works included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction.

The story of Odysseus&#39; adventures on his return home from the Trojan War has inspired the imaginations of readers for centuries and has become an integral part of our civilization&#39;s greatest artistic achievements, exerting its appeal on writers, painters, poets, film makers, and others, right up to the present time. Ian Johnston&#39;s abridged version of this magnificent poem, approximately one third the length of the original, is based upon his acclaimed new translation of the entire work (also published by Richer Resources Publications). Every line in the abridged text comes from Homer&#39;s poem, and a few short summary comments are included to keep the narrative thrust of the action coherent. This abridgment also has explanatory footnotes, a glossary of names and places, a floor plan of Odysseus&#39; palace, and a map of his route home. It thus serves as an ideal entry into Homer&#39;s poem for those who do not have the time yet to tackle the full poem.</p><p>Ian Johnston was born in Valaparaiso, Chile, and educated in Canada and England. He has a BSc from McGill in Geology and Chemistry, a BA from Bristol in English and Greek, and an MA from Toronto in English. For many years he taught as a college and universitycollege instructor in British Columbia teaching English, Classics and Liberal Studies. He is the author of The Ironies of War: An Introduction to Homer&#39;s Iliad. His translation of Homer&#39;s Iliad and Odyssey have recently been published in both book and audiobook form. He is now retired and living in Nanaimo, British Columbia."Johnston's translation is extremely faithful to Homer's Greek text, and yet at the same time is characterized by a very readable English style, so that the clarity and fluency of this translation immediately set it apart from many other alternatives. The result is an interesting and evocative synthesis of a past vision and modern sensibilities. --Dr. Anne Leavitt, Professor of Philosophy and Liberal Studies, Malaspina University-College<br><br>"Ian Johnston provides his readers with a clear and comprehensible translation of the Iliad that presents itself as a dynamic equivalent of the Greek original.

His dramatic poem <b>Paracelsus</b>, published in 1835, established his reputation and brought him the friendship of the actor-manager William Macready. When Macready's eldest son Willie was ill in bed, Browning wrote for the boy's entertainment the poem of <b>The Pied Piper</b>, a story he remembered from his own childhood. After its appearance in print in 1842, it became a children's classic, attracting new illustrators in every generation.In 1846 Robert Browning married a fellow poet, <b>Elizabeth Barrett</b>, eloping with her to Italy where they lived until Elizabeth's death in 1861. He them returned to England to live with his only sister Sarianna, but later he went back to Italy, where he died at the Rezzonico Palace in Venice.<b>Peter Washington</b> is the editor of many of the Everyman's Library Pocket Poets, including <b>Love Poems</b>, and is the author of Madame Blavatsky's <b>Baboon: A History of the Mystics</b>, <b>Mediums</b>, and <b>Misfits Who Brought Spiritualism to America</b>.</p><h2>Principles of Finance (Finance Titles in the Brigham Family)</h2><p>Develop the strong foundation in contemporary finance needed for success with PRINCIPLES OF FINANCE, 6E by leading authors Besley and Brigham.

Clover traces Eurasianism&#x2019;s origins in the writings of White Russian exiles in 1920s Europe, through Siberia&#x2019;s Gulag archipelago in the 1950s, the dissolution of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, and up to its steady infiltration of the governing elite around Vladimir Putin. This eye-opening analysis pieces together the evidence for Eurasianism&#x2019;s place at the heart of Kremlin thinking today and explores its impact on recent events, the annexation of Crimea, the rise in Russia of anti-Western paranoia and imperialist rhetoric, as well as Putin&#x2019;s sometimes perplexing political actions and ambitions.<br><br> Based on extensive research and dozens of interviews with Putin&#x2019;s close advisers, this quietly explosive story will be essential reading for anyone concerned with Russia&#x2019;s past century, and its future.</p><p>In this timely, thought-provoking study, the former Moscow bureau chief for the <i>Financial Times</i> argues that a dangerous &#x201c;Eurasianist&#x201d; ideology in modern-day Russia helps to explain the sometimes perplexing actions and ambitions of Vladimir Putin and explores what it portends for the future of the Eastern European nations.American journalist <b>Charles Clover</b> is currently the <i>Financial Times</i>&#x2019;s China correspondent.

These changes are largely due to the explosion of molecular phylogenetics and evo-devo research, emergence of the new field of animal genomics, major fossil discoveries in China, Australia, and elsewhere, and important new embryological and ultrastructural studies. As a result:<br><br>- New phyla have been described (e.g., Micrognathozoa, Xenacoelomorpha).<br>- Old phyla have been collapsed into others (e.g., Sipuncula and Echiura are now placed within Annelida; acanthocephalans are now known to be highly modified, parasitic rotifers).<br>- Phyla once thought to be deuterostomes are now part of the protostome clade (e.g., Chaetognatha, Phoronida, Bryozoa, Brachiopoda).<br>- The Protostomia has been reorganized into two major clades known as Ecdysozoa and Spiralia.<br><br>For each of the thirty-two currently recognized phyla, <em>Invertebrates</em>, Third Edition, presents detailed classifications, revised taxonomic synopses, updated information on general biology and anatomy, and current phylogenetic hypotheses, organized with boxes and tables, and illustrated with abundant line drawings and new color photos. The chapters are organized around the "new animal phylogeny," while introductory chapters provide basic background information on the general biology of invertebrates. Two new coauthors have been added to the writing team, and twenty-two additional invertebrate zoologists have contributed to chapter revisions. This benchmark volume on our modern views of invertebrate biology should be in every zoologist's library.<br><br><strong>For Instructors</strong><br><br><strong>Instructor's Resource Library: </strong>Available to qualified adopters, the Instructor's Resource Library for <em>Invertebrates</em>, Third Edition, contains an extensive collection of images for use in teaching the course:<br><br><strong>- Textbook Figures and Tables: </strong>All of the textbook's figures and tables are included as both high- and low-resolution JPEGs, for easy use in presentation software, learning management systems, and assessments.

Beginners, however, should spend some time becoming familiar in a general way with the illustrations. They are not arranged in systematic or phylogenetic order as in most ornithological works but are grouped in 8 main visual categories:<br><br> (1) Swimmers Ducks and ducklike birds (2) Aerialists Gulls and gull-like birds (3) Long-legged Waders Herons, cranes, etc.<br> (4) Smaller Waders Plovers, sandpipers, etc.<br> (5) Fowl-like Birds Grouse, quail, etc.<br> (6) Birds of Prey Hawks, eagles, owls (7) Nonpasserine Land Birds (8) Passerine (Perching) Birds<br><br> Within these groupings it will be seen that ducks do not resemble loons; gulls are readily distinguishable from terns. The needlelike bills of warblers immediately differentiate them from the seed-cracking bills of sparrows. Birds that could be confused are grouped together when possible and are arranged in identical profile for direct comparison. The arrows point to outstanding field marks&#x201d; which are explained opposite.</p><h2>Bien dit!: Student Edition Level 3 2008</h2><p>factory sealed with small tear in seal</p><p></p><h2>Spanish Is Fun: Lively Lessons for Beginners, Book 1, 3rd Edition (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p>SPANISH IS FUN BOOK 1 LIVELY LESSONS FOR BEGINNERS THIRD EDITION Spanish Is Fun, Book 1 offers an introductory program that makes language acquisition a natural, personalized, enjoyable, and rewarding experience.

With this book he offers a comprehensive, accessible guide to today's complex energy issues&#x2015;how to think clearly and logically about what is possible and what is desirable in our energy future.</p><p>After a century of unprecedented production growth, technical innovation, and expanded consumption, the world faces a number of critical energy challenges arising from unequal resource distribution, changing demand patterns, and environmental limitations. The fundamental message of <i>Energy at the Crossroads</i> is that our dependence on fossil fuels must be reduced not because of any imminent resource shortages but because the widespread burning of oil, coal, and natural gas damages the biosphere and presents increasing economic and security problems as the world relies on more expensive supplies and Middle Eastern crude oil.</p><p>Smil begins with an overview of the twentieth century's long-term trends and achievements in energy production. He then discusses energy prices, the real cost of energy, and "energy linkages"&#x2015;the effect energy issues have on the economy, on quality of life, on the environment, and in wartime. He discusses the pitfalls of forecasting, giving many examples of failed predictions and showing that unexpected events can disprove complex models. And he examines the pros and cons not only of fossil fuels but also of alternative fuels such as hydroenergy, biomass energy, wind power, and solar power. Finally, he considers the future, focusing on what really matters, what works, what is realistic, and which outcomes are most desirable.</p></p><p>Vaclav Smil is Distinguished Professor Emeritus at the University of Manitoba. He is the author of forty books, including <i>Energy and Civilization</i>, published by the MIT Press. In 2010 he was named by <i>Foreign Policy</i> as one of the Top 100 Global Thinkers. In 2013 Bill Gates wrote on his website that &#x201c;there is no author whose books I look forward to more than Vaclav Smil."<p>A wealth of very useful information about energy use, resources, and environmental and socioeconomic impact, and the author's unabashed but educated opinions about approaches to the future.

Appropriate for master&#x2019;s and doctoral level students, as well as experienced clinicians who wish to learn about supervision, it emphasizes system and relational thinking and intervention, while privileging the diversity of training system members, their realities, experiences, and interpretations of life.<br>The authors are attuned throughout the text to how and where clinical training and services are provided, and to whom, and provide detailed literature reviews for readers. These factors assist their discussion of the socio-historic development of the AAMFT supervision designation, and the fundamentals, contexts, philosophy, relationships, and pragmatics of&nbsp;CFT supervision. They also discuss major models and approaches, evaluation, ethical and legal issues, and therapist development. Perhaps most important is their presentation of methods that help tailor and extend supervision practices to meet the clinical, institutional, and economic realities that&nbsp;CF therapists navigate.<br>Readers are engaged by the discussions and exercises at the end of each chapter, which help them to feel more grounded in a topic, to have their own voices heard, and to be granted insight through experiencing multiple realities.

[They] did not disappoint me with this book, in which they provide a soup-to-nuts overview of contemporary relational supervision.... As I read this book, I took two sets of notes. One was to help me write this foreword. The more extensive set, though, was on how I might use the content of the book to structure a supervision course of my own....The authors made my job easy.&#x201d;</strong> - <em>From the Foreword, Fred P. Piercy, PhD</em></p> <p><strong>&#x201c;At last, the field of relational therapy has a wonderful authored text about supervision.&nbsp;Everyone agrees that supervision is essential but there are very few good guides as to this territory. Robert E. Lee and Thorana Nelson present a comprehensive vision of supervision in which they examine such essential topics as the key aspects of supervisory relationships, contracts, core competencies, formats, and approaches to supervision. Considerations of supervision in evidence-based models and of the cultural context for supervision are especially timely. This book should be a core text for AAMFT approved MFT programs and other programs that have a relational focus as well as a resource for every supervisor and supervisee.&#x201d;</strong> - <em>Jay Lebow, PhD, Clinical Professor, The Family Institute at Northwestern and Northwestern University<br></em>&nbsp;<br><strong>&#x201c;Wondering if you should purchase this book?&nbsp; Review the table of contents and then try not to!&nbsp;Rooted in the supervision literature and brought to life by authors who each have decades of experience, this practical, well-written book will advance the skill level of any clinical supervisor.&#x201d;</strong> - <em>Bruce Kuehl, PhD, Director, Marriage and Family Therapy Program, University of Wisconsin-Stout; Supervisor; Author of the</em> Pioneers of Family Therapy <em>publications for the AAMFT</em>&nbsp; </p> <p><strong>&#x201c;Lee and Nelson have done a real service to the profession. They provide supervisors of all experience levels a practical, comprehensive overview of the state of the art of systemic psychotherapy supervision.&#x201d;</strong> - <em>Wayne Perry, DMin, PhD, AAMFT Approved Supervisor, Clinical Programs Director, Amridge University<br></em>&nbsp;<br><strong>&#x201c;<em>The Contemporary Relational Supervisor</em> makes a long-awaited contribution to the field of couple and family supervision. No matter where you are on your supervisory journey, you will find the current information and practical application exercises you need to figure out and implement your unique approach to relational, systemic supervision.&#x201d;</strong> - <em>Dale G. Blumen, MS, LMFT, AAMFT Approved Supervisor; Supervision Course Instructor</em></p> <p><strong>&#x201c;While the literature on the supervision of couple and family therapy remains modest, it has expanded rapidly in the last decade to the point where supervisors are challenged to stay abreast of it. It is refreshing, therefore, for a book like <em>The Contemporary Relational Supervisor</em> to become available to supervisors because this book captures the primary ingredients of supervision under one cover and offers the integrated perspective of two highly experienced and knowledgeable authors.&nbsp;The book is comprehensive and meticulously referenced and thus serves both as a reference book and a guide to supervisory practice.&#x201d;</strong> - <em>Douglas C. Breunlin, MSMFT Program Director and Clinical Professor, The Family Institute at Northwestern University; Co-Editor,</em> The Handbook of Family Therapy and Supervision</p> <p>"<strong>Lee and Nelson have written a text that has just about everything you could want, and more, from a book about supervision. I say that purposefully&#x2015;it is a book about supervision, not a book that teaches you how to supervise. The authors are clear in their purpose for the book, &#x201c;... we do not attempt to teach people how to supervise; rather we seek to present multiple ideas about approaches to supervision so that learners can identify, clarify, and articulate their own perspectives and positions&#x201d; (Lee &amp; Nelson, 2013, pp. 83). While the authors state that they did not write the book to teach people how to supervise, it is clear that this book should be considered a core text for any couple and family therapy (CFT) supervision course.</strong>" -<em>&nbsp;Christopher K.

Be ready for anything. <p>Operational Risk Management offers peace of mind to business and government leaders who want their organizations to be ready for any contingency, no matter how extreme. This invaluable book is designed to be used as both a preparatory resource for when times are good and an emergency reference when times are bad. Author Mark Abkowitz gets managers up to speed on what they should be prepared to deal with and offers real solutions for putting those business continuity plans in place. From natural and man-made disasters to terrorist attacks, Operational Risk Management is destined to become every risk manager's ultimate weapon to help their organization survive &#x2014; no matter what.</p> <p>Praise for Operational Risk Management</p> <p>"Mark Abkowitz has produced an excellent and wide-ranging collection of case studies that illustrate the role that risk factors play in determining the success or failure of anything designed. In Operational Risk Management, he not only analyzes the causes of failure but also indicates how proactive risk management can lead to success. This is a very well-written and instructive book."<br> &#x2014;Henry Petroski, Aleksandar S.

Lesnick, PhD, cofounder and Senior Partner, Meridian Institute</p>Operational Risk Management <p>In the world we live in today, disasters occur on a daily basis. Could they have been prevented from occurring? If emergency response had been more effective, how much less destruction might they have caused? Will similar disasters happen again? Operational Risk Management: A Case Study Approach to Effective Planning and Response examines the safety and security of an organization's people, facilities, and assets, as well as the communities in which they are located, from exposure to natural disasters, man-made accidents, and terrorist acts that have occurred worldwide, revealing the underlying causes of these catastrophic events.</p> <p>Through the use of carefully selected case studies in a variety of scenarios across many different industries and environments, both in the United States and abroad, author and industry expert Mark Abkowitz uses historical events to demonstrate how operational risk management practices&#x2014;or the lack of them&#x2014;influence event likelihood and outcomes across all hazard domains. Each case contains a narrative, followed by a discussion that draws conclusions as to why things went wrong, as well as what, if anything, has been done to prevent such an occurrence from happening again. These include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse</p> </li> <li> <p>Nightmare in Bhopal</p> </li> <li> <p>Meltdown at Chernobyl</p> </li> <li> <p>Attack on the USS Cole</p> </li> <li> <p>September 11 &#x2013; The World Trade Center</p> </li> <li> <p>London Transit Bombings</p> </li> <li> <p>Eruption of Mount St. Helens</p> </li> <li> <p>Hurricane Katrina</p> </li> </ul> <p>In reviewing painful experiences of the past, it is clear that protecting our future cannot be left to chance. Operational Risk Management: A Case Study Approach to Effective Planning and Response not only looks at the risk factors present in previous disasters but also at the valuable lessons learned. These factors and lessons are used to forge a path forward that risk managers can use to ensure that their organizations have strong safety and security plans in place&#x2013;and are ready to respond when necessary.</p></p><h2>Purified by Fire: A History of Cremation in America</h2><p>Just one hundred years ago, Americans almost universally condemned cremation. Today, nearly one-quarter of Americans choose to be cremated. The practice has gained wide acceptance as a funeral rite, in both our private and public lives, as the cremations of icons such as John Lennon and John F. Kennedy Jr. show. <i>Purified by Fire</i> tells the fascinating story of cremation's rise from notoriety to legitimacy and takes a provocative new look at important transformations in the American cultural landscape over the last 150 years.<br><br>Stephen Prothero synthesizes a wide array of previously untapped source material, including newspapers, consumer guides, mortician trade journals, and popular magazines such as <i>Reader's Digest</i> to provide this first historical study of cremation in the United States. He vividly describes many noteworthy events&#x2014;from the much-criticized first American cremation in 1876 to the death and cremation of Jerry Garcia in the late twentieth century. From the Gilded Age to the Progressive Era to the baby boomers of today, this book takes us on a tour through American culture and traces our changing attitudes toward death, religion, public health, the body, and the environment.</p><p>"Readers of <i>Purified by Fire</i> will find themselves enthralled by their own history and left pondering the disposition of their own remains. Prothero has crafted a thoroughly admirable book, a model for writing cultural history on religiously significant topics. The scholarship is exemplary. Prothero is accurate, critical, anlaytical, and all the while, he tells a good story." &#x2014;Ronald L. Grimes, author of <i>Reading in Ritual Studies</i> (1996) and <i>Deeply into the Bone: Re-Inventing Rites of Passage</i> (2000)<br><br>"In <i>Purified by Fire</i> Stephen Prothero deals with the history of cremation in a superbly innovative and sophisticated way. His training in American religious history and the history of religion shines through, and his ability to situate debates over cremation in the larger social and cultural ecology makes the arguments even more compelling for the reader.

There is a body of knowledge unique to emergency medicine that requires continuing refinement and development. Physicians entering the practice of emergency medicine should be residency trained in emergency medicine. Quality emergency medicine is best practiced by qualified, credentialed emergency physicians. The best interests of patients are served when emergency physicians practice in a fair, equitable, and supportive environment.

In <em>Something in the Blood</em>, David J. Skal exhumes the inner world and strange genius of the writer who birthed an undying cultural icon, painting an astonishing portrait of the age in which Stoker was born&#x2015;a time when death was no metaphor but a constant threat easily imagined as a character existing in flesh and blood.</p><p>Just as in his celebrated histories <em>The Monster Show</em> and <em>Hollywood Gothic</em>, Skal draws on a wealth of newly discovered documents with "the skills of a fine detective" (<em>New York Times Book Review</em>) to challenge much of our accepted wisdom about Dracula, Stoker, and the late Victorian age. Staging Stoker&#x2019;s life against a grisly tableau of the myriad anxieties plaguing the Victorian fin de siecle, Skal investigates Stoker&#x2019;s "transgendered imagination," unearthing Stoker&#x2019;s unpublished, sexually ambiguous poetry and his passionate youthful correspondence with Walt Whitman&#x2015;printed in full here for the very first time.</p><p>Born into a middle-class Protestant family in Dublin in "Black 47"&#x2015;the year the potato famine swept the country&#x2015;Stoker was inexplicably paralyzed as a boy, and his early years unfold alongside a parade of Victorian medical mysteries and horrors: cholera and typhus, frantic bloodletting, mesmeric quack cures, and the gnawing obsession with &#x201c;bad blood&#x201d; that colors <em>Dracula</em>. While destined to become best known for his legendary undead count, Bram Stoker would become a prolific writer, critic, and theater producer, rubbing shoulders with Henry Irving, Hall Caine, and Lady Jane Wilde and her salon set&#x2015;including her fated-to-be-infamous son Oscar.</p><p>In this probing psychological and cultural portrait of the man who brought us one of the most memorable monsters in history, Skal reveals a lifetime spent wrestling with the greatest questions of an era&#x2015;a time riddled by disease, competing attitudes toward sex and gender, and unprecedented scientific innovation accompanied by rising paranoia and crises of faith. Stoker&#x2019;s battle resulted in a resilient modern folktale that continues to shock and enthrall; perhaps the most frightening thing about <em>Dracula</em>, Skal writes, "is the strong probability that it meant far less to Bram Stoker than it has come to mean to us."</p> 16 pages of color and 80 black-and-white illustrations</p><p>David J. Skal is a leading American cultural historian and critic of horror films and Gothic literature. The author of The Monster Show&nbsp;and&nbsp;Hollywood Gothic, he lives in Glendale, California.&#x201c;Sharply written, well-researched (with judicious use of recent discoveries), attentive to detail, and entertaining to read. Skal&#x2019;s is the finest, most balanced biography of Bram Stoker yet written.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sir Christopher Frayling, author of <em>Vampyres: Lord Byron to Count Dracula</em> and <em>Nightmare: The Birth of Horror</em></strong></p><h2>Applied Strength of Materials</h2><p><b> </b> This book provides comprehensive coverage of the key topics in strength of materials&#x2013;with an emphasis on applications, problem solving, and design of structural members, mechanical devices and systems.

[together] why media audiences have fled and why new technology and megacorporate ownership are putting good journalism at risk.&#x201d; &#x2014;Rasmi Simhan, <i>Boston Globe</i><br><br>&#x201c;Kovach and Rosenstiel&#x2019;s essays on each [element] are concise gems, filled with insights worthy of becoming axiomatic. . . . The book should become essential reading for journalism professionals and students and for the citizens they aim to serve.&#x201d; &#x2014;Carl Sessions Stepp, <i>American Journalism Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;If you think journalists have no idea what you want . . . here is a book that agrees with you. Better&#x2014;it has solutions. The Elements of Journalism is written for journalists, but any citizen who wonders why the news seems trivial or uninspiring should read it.&#x201d; &#x2014;Marta Salij, <i>Detroit Free Press</i><br>The elements of journalism are:<br>* Journalism&#x2019;s first obligation is to the truth.<br>* Its first loyalty is to citizens.<br>* Its essence is a discipline of verification.<br>* Its practitioners must maintain an independence from those they cover.<br>* It must serve as an independent monitor of power.<br>* It must provide a forum for public criticism and compromise.<br>* It must strive to make the significant interesting and relevant.<br>* It must keep the news comprehensive and proportional.<br>* Its practitioners must be allowed to exercise their personal conscience.</p><p>These are tough times for journalism. Newsroom executives' bonuses tend to be based on their company's profit margin. Journalists are constantly jockeying for the time and space necessary to tell their stories as they see fit. Only 47 percent of Americans even read a newspaper. And <i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i>--news magazines, remember?--"were seven times more likely to have the same cover story as <i>People</i> magazine in 1997 than in 1977."<p> It's no wonder that in 1997, the Committee of Concerned Journalists formed to "engage journalists and the public in a careful examination of what journalism was supposed to be." <i>The Elements of Journalism</i> reports the results of that study, which included 21 public forums (attended by 3,000 people), in-depth interviews with 100 journalists, editorial content studies, and research into the history of journalism. Part of what the committee members learned, they already knew. Journalism is complicated business: journalists are paid by management but work for the citizens; they tend to be self-taught (there is little evidence of mentoring and much disdain for journalism schools); and they need to be objective even when they're not impartial. This has always been the case. But the committee also detected a trend, one abundantly evident to anyone who has tried to find news on the evening TV news: "news was becoming entertainment and entertainment news."</p><p> "Unless we can grasp and reclaim the theory of a free press," warn Bill Kovach and Tom Rosenstiel, the book's authors, "journalists risk allowing their profession to disappear." Through their discussions with journalists, the Committee of Concerned Journalists defined nine "clear principles" of journalism, which Kovach and Rosenstiel explore in great detail. The first principle is, "Journalism's first obligation is to the truth." The last: "Its practitioners must be allowed to exercise their personal conscience." In between come issues of loyalty, verification, independence, and power monitoring, among others.</p><p> Invigorating reading for newsroom interns, jaded reporters, and anyone else who needs to be reminded of the rigorousness, integrity, and meaning of journalism. <i>--Jane Steinberg</i></p>"At a time when technological and financial forces are creating formidable challenges to journalism's traditional values, Kovach and Rosenstiel have written an immensely valuable primer on who we are, what we do, and how we should do it."<br>-- David Halberstam<br><br>"<b>The Elements of Journalism</b> is a remarkable book that does a superb job of describing the problems, articulating the values, outlining the risks, and offering understandable and practical ways to respond to the difficulties of the present state of journalism. <b>The Elements of Journalism </b>ought to become required reading for every institution (and individual) engaged in journalism."<br> &#x2014; Neil Rudenstine, President, Harvard University<br><br>"Of the many books that have been written about reporting the news, this one best captures the shortcomings, subtleties, and possibilities of modern journalism. It deserves to become as indispensable to journalists and journalism students as <b>The Elements of Style</b>."<br> &#x2014; Tom Goldstein, Dean, Graduate School of Journalism, Columbia University<br><br>"In an age when partisan rancor and ratings-driven showmanship have crowded out the more subtle virtues of solid journalism, Tom Rosenstiel and Bill Kovach provide a timely refresher course in the importance of press fundamentals. They remind us that at its best, journalism is a high public calling, and all those who practice it have a deeper obligation to their readers and viewers than to the demands of the market."<br> &#x2014; David Talbot, editor-in-chief, Salon.com</p><h2>Brevity: A Flash Fiction Handbook</h2><p>In <i>Brevity</i>, David Galef provides a guide to writing flash fiction, from tips on technique to samples by canonical and contemporary authors to provocative prompts that inspire powerful stories in a little space.

Renowned author and critic Arthur C. Danto addresses this fundamental, complex question. Part philosophical monograph and part memoiristic meditation, <i>What Art Is </i>challenges the popular interpretation that art is an indefinable concept, instead bringing to light the properties that constitute universal meaning. Danto argues that despite varied approaches, a work of art is always defined by two essential criteria: meaning and embodiment, as well as one additional criterion contributed by the viewer: interpretation. Danto crafts his argument in an accessible manner that engages with both philosophy and art across genres and eras, beginning with Plato&#x2019;s definition of art in <i>The Republic</i>, and continuing through the progress of art as a series of discoveries, including such innovations as perspective, chiaroscuro, and physiognomy. Danto concludes with a fascinating discussion of Andy Warhol&#x2019;s famous shipping cartons, which are visually indistinguishable from the everyday objects they represent.</p><p>Throughout, Danto considers the contributions of philosophers including Descartes, Kant, and Hegel, and artists from Michelangelo and Poussin to Duchamp and Warhol, in this far-reaching examination of the interconnectivity and universality of aesthetic production.</p></p><p><b>Arthur C. Danto </b>was Johnsonian Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at Columbia University and art critic for <i>The Nation</i>."Danto is an elegant and erudite writer, and his sentences go down smoothly."&#x2014;Deborah Solomon, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br>"Danto was and remains the high priest of pluralism, and arch-critic of the view that art has a distinctive essence."&#x2014;A. C. Grayling, <i>Financial Times</i><br>". . . arguably the most inspired interpreter of the increasingly abstruse art world that emerged during the past half century. In <i>What Art Is</i>, Danto's freewheeling erudition and knack for unpacking complex subjects is on display."&#x2014;Eric Been, <i>Chicago Tribune</i> (&#x201c;Favorite Books of 2013&#x201d;)<br>"Danto&#x2019;s writing is elegant and his insights acute."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>"The conclusion [Danto] reaches . . . is elegant in its clearheaded take on an endlessly difficult question. . . . As a critical memoir . . . tracing the particulars of a gifted mind&#x2019;s lasting focus, Danto&#x2019;s latest is a useful addition to a long career."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br>"The brilliant, eminently entertaining philosopher-critic Arthur C. Danto lays bare an oft-pondered question in <i>What Art Is</i>."&#x2014;<i>Interior Design</i><br>"This rich, filling little book should be savored slowly, one chapter at a time . . . the art critic and philosopher has managed to corral a remarkable breadth of art history and critical thought to the service of his own observations. . . . a persuasive book."&#x2014;Edith Newhall, <i>ARTnews</i><br>"Provocative yet accessible."&#x2014;<i>Art Business News</i><br>"Elaborating important themes of Danto&#x2019;s influential aesthetics,<i> What Art Is</i> develops them in fascinating new ways, offering luminous interpretations of past masters ranging from Michelangelo and Poussin to Duchamp and Warhol. Written in Danto&#x2019;s engagingly personal voice, the book&#x2019;s essays sparkle with wit, erudition, sensitivity, and a profound love of art whose power is captivatingly contagious."&#x2014;Richard Shusterman, author of&nbsp;<i>Thinking through the Body: Essays in Somaesthetics</i><br>"This miraculously economical book summarizes many decades of reflection and provides an ideal entry into the philosophical system of the most important American-born writer who has discussed visual art."&#x2014;David Carrier, author of <i>Proust/Warhol: Analytical Philosophy of Art</i><br><p>"Arthur Danto is America&#x2019;s leading philosopher of art: deeply knowledgeable, clear sighted, adventurous."&#x2014;Richard Sennett, author of&nbsp;<i>The Craftsman</i></p><br></p><h2>Communication Research: Asking Questions, Finding Answers</h2><p><p>Communication Research: Asking Questions, Finding Answers covers basic research issues and processes, both quantitative and qualitative, appropriate for communication students with little or no previous research methods experience.

His time there was no more successful than an earlier attempt to find work with the Central Intelligence Agency. At loose ends, Falk turned to an old college interest: acting. He came to prominence as an actor in 1956 in the highly successful Off-Broadway revival of <em>The Iceman Cometh</em> with Jason Robards. Although he worked continuously for the next three years, bouncing from one Off-Broadway theater to the next, a theatrical agent advised him not to expect much work in motion pictures because of his glass eye. Surgeons had removed his right eye, along with a malignant tumor, when he was three years old. <br><br>But in 1958, the actor made the jump to Hollywood, where he landed his first movie, <em>Murder Incorporated,</em> and was nominated for an Oscar. Next came Frank Capra's <em>A Pocketful of Miracles</em> starring Bette Davis, which garnered Falk his second Oscar nomination. Falk was a favorite among moviegoers during the 1960s, admired for his roles in classic comedies such as <em>It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World</em> and <em>The Great Race.</em> However, it was through his collaboration with filmmaker John Cassavetes that Falk entered into his most creative period in 1970. Motion pictures such as <em>Husbands</em> and <em>A Woman Under the Influence</em> helped launch the independent film movement. Nevertheless, Falk continued to act in light film comedies, including <em>The In-Laws</em> and Neil Simon's <em>The Cheap Detective</em> and <em>Murder by Death,</em> among others. <br><br>Yet it was through television that Falk reached his widest audience. He has portrayed the beloved Lt. Columbo since the 1970s, winning four Emmys. The series was so successful that ten years after it's demise, Columbo was re-launched, bringing Falk to a new generation of viewers. <i> Just One More Thing</i> also chronicles the author's later work, such as movie appearances in <em>A Shark's Tale</em> and Paul Reiser's <em>The Thing About My Folks,</em> as well stories of growing up in New York, Hollywood and Broadway luminaries, and the author's accomplished passion for drawing and painting.<br></p><p><b>Peter Falk </b>appeared in over forty-one motion pictures, numerous plays, and many television programs, most notably <i>Columbo</i>.</p><h2>The Summer of 1787: The Men Who Invented the Constitution (Simon &amp; Schuster America Collection)</h2><p><i>The Summer of 1787</i> takes us into the sweltering room in which the founding fathers struggled for four months to produce the Constitution: the flawed but enduring document that would define the nation&#x2014;then and now.<br><br>George Washington presided, James Madison kept the notes, Benjamin Franklin offered wisdom and humor at crucial times. <i>The Summer of 1787</i> traces the struggles within the Philadelphia Convention as the delegates hammered out the charter for the world&#x2019;s first constitutional democracy. Relying on the words of the delegates themselves to explore the Convention&#x2019;s sharp conflicts and hard bargaining, David O. Stewart lays out the passions and contradictions of the, often, painful process of writing the Constitution.<br> <br>It was a desperate balancing act. Revolutionary principles required that the people have power, but could the people be trusted? Would a stronger central government leave room for the states? Would the small states accept a Congress in which seats were allotted according to population rather than to each sovereign state? And what of slavery? The supercharged debates over America&#x2019;s original sin led to the most creative and most disappointing political deals of the Convention.<br> <br>The room was crowded with colorful and passionate characters, some known&#x2014;Alexander Hamilton, Gouverneur Morris, Edmund Randolph&#x2014;and others largely forgotten. At different points during that sultry summer, more than half of the delegates threatened to walk out, and some actually did, but Washington&#x2019;s quiet leadership and the delegates&#x2019; inspired compromises held the Convention together.<br> <br>In a country continually arguing over the document&#x2019;s original intent, it is fascinating to watch these powerful characters struggle toward consensus&#x2014;often reluctantly&#x2014;to write a flawed but living and breathing document that could evolve with the nation.</p><p>David O. Stewart is an award-winning author and the president of the <i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>. He is the author of several acclaimed histories, including <i>Madison&#x2019;s Gift: Five Partnerships That Built America</i>; <i>The Summer of 1787: The Men Who Invented the Constitution</i>;<i> Impeached: The Trial of President Andrew Johnson and the Fight for Lincoln&#x2019;s Legacy</i>; and <i>American Emperor: Aaron Burr&#x2019;s Challenge to Jefferson&#x2019;s America</i>. Stewart&#x2019;s first novel is <i>The Lincoln Deception</i>.<p><b>Chapter Four</b></p><p><b><i>Demigods and Coxcombs Assemble</i></b></p><p><b>MAY 1787</b></p><p>James Madison reached Philadelphia on May 3, ten whole days before any other delegate (except for the ones who lived there), and eleven days before the Convention was scheduled to begin. His early arrival reflected both his eagerness and his lifelong habit of exacting preparation. Always gentle with his health when he could be, the Virginian gave himself ample time to recover from the grinding stagecoach ride from New York, where he had been representing Virginia in the Confederation Congress.</p><p>Although Philadelphia was the nation's largest city, home to about 40,000 people, lodging was at a premium. In addition to the Federal Convention (as it was called), the city was hosting a gathering of Presbyterian ministers from around the country. Also in town was the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of Continental Army officers that some feared as a political force. <i>The Pennsylvania Herald</i> took pride in the confluence:</p><blockquote><p>Here, at the same moment, the collective wisdom of the continent deliberates upon the extensive politics of the confederated empire, an Episcopal convention clears and distributes the streams of religion throughout the American world, and those veterans whose valor and perseverance accomplished a mighty revolution are once more assembled. . . .</p></blockquote><p>Madison settled in at Mrs. House's boardinghouse at Fifth and Market, where Virginians on public business often stayed. It was familiar ground. Madison had lodged with Mrs. House in 1783 during his first term in the Confederation Congress, and the quiet, serious Virginian was little trouble. As one contemporary described him, "His ordinary manner was simple, modest, bland, and unostentatious, retiring from the throng and cautiously refraining from doing or saying anything to make himself conspicuous." Another attributed to him "an air of reflection which is not very distant from gravity and self-sufficiency," but also found "little of that warmth of heart."</p><p>In the ten days until the next delegate arrived, Madison could review the two essays he had written in anticipation of the great convention. The first was an examination of republics and confederacies throughout history, including Belgium, Switzerland, and Germany, along with classical examples -- the Lycian, Amphictyonic, and Achean republics. His second essay, called "Madison's Vices" in ironic tribute to its author's undoubted virtue, was an incisive catalog of the infirmities of the Articles. The vices numbered eleven, and the remedy for all of them was a strong central government. The Virginian was keenly aware of the risk that strong governments may take oppressive measures, as the British Parliament had. His goal was a government that not only was strong, but also would respect the rights of its citizens.</p><p>For Madison, the accommodation of competing forces was the central job of government. "All civilized societies are divided into different interests and factions," he wrote, including "debtors or creditors," "rich or poor," "members of different religious sects," "followers of different political leaders," "inhabitants of different districts," or "husbandmen, merchants or manufacturers." Government must be "sufficiently neutral between the different interests and factions, to control one part of the society from invading the rights of another."</p><p>During those ten days on his own, Madison did more than plan for the coming conclave. Correspondence from home forced his attention to his responsibilities as a slave owner. Had other servants or slaves assisted the escape of Anthony, a runaway brought back to the plantation? Madison had to judge the case from afar. He also called on Dr. Benjamin Franklin, his fellow delegate and recently installed as president of Pennsylvania. Feeling his eighty-one years, Franklin went out little but was happy to receive guests in his garden, particularly under a favorite mulberry tree. Knowing of the slight Virginian's role in pushing for the Convention and of his relationship with Washington, Franklin extended to the younger man the respect warranted by both.</p><p>General Washington arrived second, having taken five days to cover the 140 miles from Mount Vernon in his own carriage, driven by his slaves. The contrast with Madison's quiet entry into Philadelphia was stark.</p><p>At midday on May 13, the General was at Mrs. Withy's Inn in Chester, south of the city, dining with former army colleagues. The party pressed on to a greeting by the Philadelphia Light Horse, nattily turned out in white britches, high boots, and black and silver hats. The troopers escorted the hero over a floating bridge that spanned the Schuylkill River. An artillery company fired a thirteen-gun salute (once for each state), church bells pealed, and cheering crowds lined the streets despite what the <i>Pennsylvania Herald</i> called "the badness of the weather." It was another demonstration, if one was needed, that it was within the General's power to be an American Caesar.</p><p>Like Madison, Washington had taken rooms with Mrs. House. Alighting at her establishment, he was met by the financier Robert Morris and his wife, who prevented the General from unloading his luggage. Washington had declined the Morrises' written offer of lodging during the Convention, but they would not accept his refusal in person. They bundled the General to their home, acclaimed the finest in the city, a short walk away. Washington did not tarry there, but immediately set off to pay his own respects to Dr. Franklin. Along that four-block jaunt, he shook hands with Philadelphians, who cheered and gaped at the tall man with such an impressive bearing.</p><p>Though the Morrises' intervention meant that Madison and Washington would not share the same roof, the studious younger man must have felt a particular satisfaction in the General's arrival. Applying the General's stature to Madison's strategy, they had formed an effective partnership in bringing the Convention to pass. Madison was relying on that partnership to continue through the summer. Their challenges would increase as Philadelphia filled with delegates who had different visions of the nation to be formed, and different interests to protect.</p><p></p><p>On the next morning, May 14, Washington and Madison walked the short distance to the Pennsylvania State House (today called Independence Hall) for the scheduled opening of the Convention. They strode through a light drizzle with three more Virginians who had just arrived -- George Wythe, John Blair, and James McClurg.</p><p>Wythe, sixty-one, was America's first law professor. At the College of William and Mary he trained a generation of leaders that included Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall, and James Monroe. A signer of the Declaration of Independence and former Speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates, Wythe was his state's leading judge from 1778 until his death in 1806. Blair, fifty-five, served alongside Wythe on Virginia's chancery court and had participated in his state's constitutional convention. McClurg, forty-one, a physician and professor at William and Mary, was a member of Virginia's executive council.</p><p>Thanks to a cold winter and a wet spring, the Virginians shared the streets with Philadelphia's aggravating black flies, which would linger through the humid summer. At the State House, they found only one other delegation, the Pennsylvanians led by Dr. Franklin. Raw weather had delayed many delegates, but the Pennsylvanians brought flair enough for the occasion.</p><p>The Pennsylvania Assembly elected its delegates in late 1786, almost two months before Congress endorsed the Convention. As the second largest state (after Virginia), Pennsylvania was essential to any effort to remake the government. The state's cosmopolitan outlook derived from its diverse population, which included German immigrants, Quakers, and free blacks. Where the Virginians had forebears rooted in their state's soil for a century and more, the eight Pennsylvanians were more mobile and more urban. Three were immigrants: Thomas Fitzsimons from Ireland, Robert Morris from England, and James Wilson from Scotland. Three hailed from other states: Connecticut (Jared Ingersoll), New York (Gouverneur Morris, who still lived there), and Massachusetts (Franklin).</p><p>All eight Pennsylvanians worked at city-based pursuits like trade and law. Only a week before, six of them had been at Dr. Franklin's for a session of the Society for Political Inquiries. The presentation was on American trade and manufacturing, matters of less than the first moment to Virginia planters, but central to the national future.</p><p>At the Convention, the most prominent Pennsylvania delegates were the ones chosen last. When the state Assembly voted, James Wilson and Gouverneur Morris trailed less-distinguished colleagues by a wide margin, while Franklin was omitted altogether because he was thought too ill to serve. He was later unanimously added to the delegation when his health proved adequate to the task. Each of those three brought noteworthy qualities.</p><p>None could match Dr. Franklin for political theater, beginning with his universally recognized title of "Doctor." The title dated from his honorary degree from St. Andrews in Scotland, granted for his scientific achievements (as were his honorary degrees from Oxford, Harvard, Yale, and William and Mary -- not bad for a man who left school at the age of ten).</p><p>When attending diplomatic soir�es in Paris, his theatrical instincts had draped him in American homespun and crowned him with fur caps. Now he challenged American rusticity by traveling in a glass-windowed sedan chair from France, borne by four husky prisoners from the nearby Walnut Street jail. As Dr. Franklin progressed through Philadelphia's republican streets, his regal trappings drove home the message that honor in America grew from talent, not birth. Yet the swaying procession also must have brought a smile to those it passed, and to the doctor himself.</p><p>At eighty-one, Franklin most nearly contended with Washington for celebrity a...</p></p><h2>The Ultimate Survival Manual (Outdoor Life Extreme Edition): Modern Day Survival | Avoid Diseases | Quarantine Tips</h2><p><b>Get ready, get set, SURVIVE! </b>This updated and extreme edition of the popular, bestselling 2012 title is what you need if you want to protect your family, save yourself, and prevail over any danger.

In addition, large numbers of full-time, seminary trained clergy are retiring, without commensurate numbers of new clergy able to take their place. As a result of these trends, a large number of lay preachers and bivocational pastors have assumed the principal responsibility for filling the pulpit week by week in local churches. Most of these individuals, observes Clifton Guthrie, can draw on a wealth of life experiences, as well as strong intuitive skills in knowing what makes a good sermon, having listened to them much of their lives. What they often don't bring to the pulpit, however, is specific, detailed instruction in the how-tos of preaching. That is precisely what this brief, practical guide to preaching has to offer. <br> <br> Written with the needs of those for whom preaching is not their sole or primary occupation in mind, it begins by emphasizing what every preacher brings to the pulpit: an idea of what makes a sermon particularly moving or memorable to them. From there the book moves into short chapters on choosing an appropriate biblical text or sermon topic, learning how to listen to one's first impressions of what a text means, moving from text or topic to the sermon itself while keeping the listeners needs firmly in mind, making thorough and engaging use of stories in the sermon, and delivering with passion and conviction. The book concludes with helpful suggestions for resources, including Bibles, commentaries, other print resources and websites.</p><p>Clifton Guthrie is Assistant Professor of Homiletics and Pastoral Studies at Bangor Theological Seminary in Bangor, Maine. He currently serves as the co-editor of Doxology: A Journal of Worship. Cliff has extensive teaching background at Candler School of Theology as well, having taught courses on systematic theology, preaching, United Methodist history, and worship and spirituality. His writing and editing credits include For All the Saints: A Calendar of Commemorations for United Methodists and numerous reviews and articles on the Christian calendar; pastoral care and practice, and worship issues. Cliff previously served as a local church pastor and youth minister and as an editor at the United Methodist Publishing House.

This small farm on the outer reaches of Cape Cod is a place that is as bewitching and alive as the characters we meet: Violet, a brilliant girl who is in love with books and with a man destined to betray her; Lysander Wynn, attacked by a halibut as big as a horse, certain that his life is ruined until a boarder wearing red boots <br>arrives to change everything; Maya Cooper, who does not understand the true meaning of the love between her mother and father until it is nearly too late.

She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts.THE EDGE OF THE WORLD<br>I.<br>It was said that boys should go on their first sea voyage at the age of ten, but surely this notion was never put forth by anyone's mother. If the bay were to be raised one degree in temperature for every woman who had lost the man or child she loved at sea, the water would have boiled, throwing off steam even in the dead of winter, poaching the bluefish and herrings as they swam.<br><br>Every May, the women in town gathered at the wharf. No matter how beautiful the day, scented with new grass or spring onions, they found themselves wishing for snow and ice, for gray November, for December's gales and land-locked harbors, for fleets that returned, safe and sound, all hands accounted for, all boys grown into men. Women who had never left Massachusetts dreamed of the Middle Banks and the Great Banks the way some men dreamed of hell: The place that could give you everything you might need and desire. The place that could take it all away.<br><br>This year the fear of what might be was worse than ever, never mind gales and storms and starvation and accidents, never mind rum and arguments and empty nets. This year the British had placed an embargo on the ships of the Cape. No one could go in or out of the harbor, except unlawfully, which is what the fishermen in town planned to do come May, setting off on moonless nights, a few sloops at a time, with the full knowledge that every man caught would be put to death for treason and every boy would be sent to Dartmoor Prison in England--as good as death, people in town agreed, but colder and some said more miserable.<br><br>Most people made their intentions known right away, those who would go and those who would stay behind to man the fort beside Long Pond if need be, a battle station that was more of a cabin than anything, but at least it was something solid to lean against should a man have to take aim and fire. John Hadley was among those who wanted to stay. He made that clear, and everyone knew he had his reasons. He had just finished the little house in the hollow that he'd been working on with his older son, Vincent, for nearly three years. During this time, John Hadley and Vincent had gone out fishing each summer, searching out bluefish and halibut, fish large enough so that you could fill up your catch in a very short time. John's sloop was small, his desires were few: he wanted to give his wife this house, nothing fancy, but carefully made all the same, along with the acreage around it, a meadow filled with wild grapes and winterberry. Wood for building was hard to come by, so John had used old wrecked boats for the joists, deadwood he'd found in the shipyard, and when there was none of that to be had, he used fruitwood he'd culled from his property, though people insisted applewood and pear wouldn't last. There was no glass in the windows, only oiled paper, but the light that came through was dazzling and yellow; little flies buzzed in and out of the light, and everything seemed slow, molasses slow, lovesick slow.<br><br>John Hadley felt a deep love for his wife, Coral, more so than anyone might guess. He was still tongue-tied in her presence, and he had the foolish notion that he could give her something no other man could. Something precious and lasting and hers alone. It was the house he had in mind whenever he looked at Coral. This was what love was to him: when he was at sea he could hardly sleep without the feel of her beside him. She was his anchor, she was his home; she was the road that led to everything that mattered to John Hadley.<br><br>Otis West and his cousin Harris Maguire had helped with the plans for the house--a keeping room, an attic for the boys, a separate chamber for John and Coral. These men were good neighbors, and they'd helped again when the joists were ready, even though they both thought John was a fool for giving up the sea. A man didn't give up who he was, just to settle down. He didn't trade his freedom for turnips. Still, these neighbors spent day after day working alongside John and Vincent, bringing their oxen to help lift the crossbeams, hollering for joy when the heart of the work was done, ready to get out the good rum. The town was like that: for or against you, people helped each other out. Even old Margaret Swift, who was foolish enough to have raised the British flag on the pole outside her house, was politely served when she came into the livery store, though there were folks in town who believed that by rights she should be drinking tar and spitting feathers.<br><br>John's son Vincent was a big help in the building of the house, just as he was out at sea, and because of this they would soon be able to move out of the rooms they let at Hannah Crosby's house. But Isaac, the younger boy, who had just turned ten, was not quite so helpful. He meant to be, but he was still a child, and he'd recently found a baby blackbird that kept him busy. Too busy for other chores, it seemed. First, he'd had to feed the motherless creature every hour with crushed worms and johnnycake crumbs, then he'd had to drip water into the bird's beak from the tip of his finger. He'd started to hum to the blackbird, as if it were a real baby. He'd started to talk to it when he thought no one could overhear.<br><br>"Wild creatures belong in the wild," Coral Hadley told her son. All the same, she had difficulty denying Isaac anything. Why, she let the boy smuggle his pet into the rooms they let at the Crosbys' boarding house, where he kept the blackbird in a wooden box beside his bed.<br><br>The real joy of the house they were building, as much for John as for anyone, was that it was, indeed, a farm. They would have cows and horses to consider, rather than halibut and bluefish; predictable beasts at long last, and a large and glorious and predictable meadow as well. Rather than the cruel ocean, there would be fences, and a barn, and a deep cistern of cold well water, the only water John's boys would need or know, save for the pond at the rear of the property, where damselflies glided above the mallows in spring. John Hadley had begun to talk about milk cows and crops. He'd become fascinated with turnips, how hardy they were, how easy to grow, even in sandy soil. In town, people laughed at him. John Hadley knew this, and he didn't care. He'd traveled far enough in his lifetime. Once, he'd been gone to the island of Nevis all summer long with the Crosbys on their sloop; he'd brought Coral back an emerald, he'd thought then that was what she wanted most in the world. But she'd told him to sell it and buy land. She knew that was what he wanted.<br><br>Coral was a good woman, and John was a handsome man, tall, with dark hair and darker eyes, a Cornishman, as tough as men from Cornwall always were. All the same, he didn't have too much pride to herd sheep, or clean out a stable, or plant corn and turnips, though it meant a long-term battle with brambles and nettle. Still, his was a town of fishermen; much as soldiers who can never leave their country once they've buried their own in the earth, so here it was the North Atlantic that called to them, a graveyard for sure, but home just as certainly. And John was still one of them, at least for the present time. If a man in these parts needed to earn enough to buy fences and cows and turnips, he knew where he had to go. It would only be from May to July, John figured, and that would be the end of it, especially if he was helped by his two strong sons.<br><br>They moved into the house in April, a pale calm day when the buds on the lilacs their neighbors had planted as a welcome were just about to unfold. The house was finished enough to sleep in; there was a fireplace where Coral could cook, and the rest would come eventually. Quite suddenly, John and Coral felt as though time was unlimited, that it was among the things that would never be in short supply.<br><br>"That's where the horses will be," John Hadley told Coral. They were looking out over the field that belonged to them, thanks to those years John had spent at sea and the emerald they'd sold. "I'll name one Charger. I had a horse called that when I was young."<br><br>Coral laughed to think of him young. She saw her boys headed for the pond. The blackbird chick rode on Isaac's shoulder and flapped his wings. It was their first day, the beginning of everything. Their belongings were still in crates.<br><br>"I'll just take him with me and Vincent this one time," John said. "I promise. Then we'll concentrate on turnips."<br><br>"No," Coral said. She wanted three milk cows and four sheep and her children safe in their own beds. She thought about her youngest, mashing worms into paste for his fledgling. "Isaac can't go."<br><br>By then the brothers had reached the shores of the little pond. The frogs jumped away as they approached. The blackbird, frightened by the splashing, hopped into the safety of Isaac's shirt, and sent out a small muffled cry.<br><br>"He's like a hen," the older brother jeered. At fifteen, Vincent had grown to his full height, six foot, taller than his father; he was full of himself and how much he knew. He'd been to sea twice, after all, and he figured he was as good as any man; he already had calluses on his hands. He didn't need to go to school anymore, which was just as well, since he'd never been fond of his lessons. "He doesn't even know he can fly," he said of his brother's foundling.<br><br>"I'll teach him." Isaac felt in his shirt for the blackbird. The feathers reminded him of water, soft and cool. Sometimes Isaac let the chick sleep right beside him, on the quilt his mother had sewn out of indigo homespun.<br><br>"Nah, you won't. He's a big baby. Just like you are. He'll be walking around on your shoulder for the rest of his life."<br><br>After that, Isaac brought the blackbird into the woods every day, just to prove Vincent wrong. He climbed into one of the tall oaks and let his legs dangle over a high limb. He urged the blackbird to fly away, but the bird was now his pet, too attached to ever leave; the poor thing merely paced on his shoulder and squawked. Isaac decided to name his pet Ink. Ink was an indoor bird, afraid of the wind, and of others of his own kind. He hopped around the parlor, and nested beneath the woodstove, where it was so hot he singed his feathers. He sat on the table and sipped water from a saucer while Isaac did his studies. It was a navigation book Isaac was studying. The Practical Navigator. If he was not as strong as Vincent, or as experienced, then at least he could memorize the chart of the stars; he could know the latitude of where they were going and where they'd been.<br><br>"Do you think I could teach him to talk?" Isaac said dreamily to his mother one day. Ink was perched on the tabletop, making a nuisance of himself.<br><br>"What would a blackbird have to say?" Coral laughed.<br><br>"He'd say: <i>I'll never leave you. I'll be with you for all time</i>."<br><br>Hearing those words, Coral felt faint; she said she needed some air. She went into the yard and faced the meadow and gazed at the way the tall grass moved in the wind. That night she said to her husband again, "Don't take him with you, John."<br><br>April was ending, with sheets of rain and the sound of the peepers calling from the shore of the pond. Classes would end in a few days, too--they called it a fisherman's school, so that boys were free to be sent out to work with their fathers or uncles or neighbors from May till October. The Hadleys left in the first week of that mild month, a night when there was no moon. The fog had come in; so much the better when it came to sneaking away. The British had lookouts to the east and the west, and it was best to take a northerly route. They brought along molasses, the fishing nets, johnnycake, and salted pork, and, unknown to John and Vincent, Isaac took along his blackbird as well, tucked into his jacket. As they rounded the turn out of their own harbor, Isaac took his pet from his hiding place.<br><br>"You could do it now if you wanted to," he said to the bird. "You could fly away."<br><br>But the blackbird shivered in the wind, startled, it seemed, by the sound of water. He scrambled back to the safety of Isaac's jacket, feathers puffed up, the way they always were when he was frightened.<br><br>"I told you he'd never fly." Vincent had spied the blackbird. He nudged his brother so that Isaac would help check the nets. "He's pathetic, really."<br><br>"No, he's not!"<br><br>By now they were past the fog that always clung to shore at this time of year, and the night was clear. There were so many stars in the sky, and the vast expanse of dark and light was frightening. The water was rougher than Isaac had ever seen it in their bay, and they were still not even halfway to the Middle Banks. The sloop seemed small out here, far too breakable.<br><br>"Is this the way it always is?" Isaac asked his brother. He felt sick to his stomach; there was a lurching in his bones and blood. He thought about the oak tree and the meadow and the frogs and the way his mother looked at him when he came in through the door.<br><br>"It's the way it is tonight," Vincent said.<br><br>Used to the sea, Vincent fell asleep easily, but Isaac couldn't close his eyes. John Hadley understood; he came to sit beside the boy. It was so dark that every star in the sky hung suspended above the mast, as though only inches above them. Isaac recognized the big square of Pegasus that he'd seen in his book. The night looked like spilled milk, and John Hadley pointed out Leo, the harbinger of spring, then the North Star, constant as always. John could hear the chattering of the blackbird in his son's waistcoat. He could taste his wife's farewell kiss.<br><br>"What happens if a storm comes up?" Isaac said, free to be frightened now that his brother was asleep, free to be the boy he still was. "What happens if I'm thrown overboard? Or if a whale comes along? What happens then?"<br><br>"Then I'll save you." When the wind changed John Hadley smelled turnips, he really did, and he laughed at the scent of it, how it had followed him all this way to the Middle Banks, to remind him of everything he had to lose.</p><h2>The Life We Never Expected: Hopeful Reflections on the Challenges of Parenting Children with Special Needs</h2><p><p>Sometimes life throws you a curveball.</p><p>Andrew and Rachel Wilson know what it means to live a life they never expected.

This isn&#x2019;t a book that&#x2019;s going to tell you to pull yourself up by your bootstraps and try harder. This is a book for those who are on the floor, weeping, because they need to know Jesus is with them.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Russell Moore,</strong>&nbsp;President, The Ethics &amp; Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention</p><p>&#x201c;What a great book! Andrew and Rachel&#x2019;s surprise journey with their two autistic children opened the door to knowing God and his ways more deeply. They learned, or should I say experienced, that the gospel isn&#x2019;t something you just believe; it is something you inhabit when God permits long-term suffering in your life. I&#x2019;d recommend this book even if your family doesn&#x2019;t have a child affected by disability&#x2015;it is soul food.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Paul E. Miller,</strong>&nbsp;author, <em>A Praying Life</em> and <em>J-Curve: Dying and Rising with Jesus in Everyday Life</em></p><p>&#x201c;Weeping, worshiping, waiting, witnessing, and breathing. These are the constant rhythms of my life as a parent to a son with autism. These are also the rhythms of Andrew and Rachel Wilson&#x2019;s life, beautifully and delicately illustrated in <em>The Life We Never Expected</em>. The Wilsons have managed to do what no other authors have&#x2015;provide me with clear, promising hope as a special-needs parent and allow me the sacred practice of saying, &#x2018;Me, too.&#x2019; Profoundly moving and deeply rooted in the love of Jesus, this book is exactly what I needed. It is a tremendous gift.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nish Weiseth,</strong> speaker; author, <em>Speak: How Your Story Can Change the World</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is a poignant and delightfully forthright book, written by parents who are still clearly raw from their experiences.

Their candidness is infectious, inviting us to do what the church should do: laugh with those who laugh and mourn with those who mourn. Parents of special-needs children will find compassionate solidarity, honest wrestling, voiced frustrations, and, most importantly, the gospel. Many will read this book and feel understood. Others of us need to read this book to understand, so that we can walk alongside those in the midst of hardship with compassion.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Nate Pyle,</strong> Pastor, Christ&#x2019;s Community Church, Fishers, Indiana; author, <em>Man Enough: How Jesus Redefines Manhood</em></p><p>&#x201c;In a striking display of honesty and depth, Andrew and Rachel Wilson explore the tension of faith and reality in this moving book. What I love most is that it&#x2019;s written in &#x2018;real time.&#x2019; They reflect on the pain and joy not after the fact but while they are experiencing it. <em>The Life We Never Expected</em> is one of those books you have to force yourself to put down. You will laugh, you will cry, and you will celebrate the goodness of God&#x2015;even in the midst of suffering.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Preston Sprinkle,</strong> Vice President of Boise Extension, Eternity Bible College; author, <em>People to Be Loved: Why Homosexuality Is Not Just an Issue</em></p><p>&#x201c;I am not a parent of children with special needs. In fact, I&#x2019;m not a parent at all. Even so, I couldn&#x2019;t put this book down. <em>The Life We Never Expected</em> is about so much more than parenting. It is about loss, lament, hope, humility, contentment, joy&#x2015;and about finding God to be more than sufficient through it all.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Karen Swallow Prior,</strong> author, <em>On Reading Well</em> and <em>Fierce Convictions</em></p><p>&#x201c;This is a sweet and touching book&#x2015;a testimony of parents&#x2019; love for their special, vulnerable children, and an extended meditation on the nature of the suffering that is part of the Christian life. Andrew and Rachel write with frank honesty and a sensitivity to biblical teaching about the expectations for life in a fallen world. I hope this little book will bring wise comfort to other parents facing similar challenges.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Carl R. Trueman,</strong> Professor of Biblical and Religious Studies, Grove City College</p><p>&#x201c;This is a helpful book both for those experiencing disability in their families and for those who love such families&#x2015;not because of how the Wilsons are &#x2018;dealing&#x2019; with disability but in how they rightly orient to our great and purposeful God. Having parented a child with multiple disabilities for more than two decades, I smiled regularly at their honest portrayal of life with disability. Anger, disappointment, and confusion along with delight and insight are offered in right measures. As both Andrew and Rachel point out, families like ours frequently do not experience the &#x2018;great resolution&#x2019; about the circumstances of our lives, but we can always trust the promises of the One who made and sustains us and who will ultimately make all things new.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John Knight,</strong> Director of Donor Partnerships, desiringGod.org</p></p><h2>Achieving Excellence in Fundraising (Essential Texts for Nonprofit and Public Leadership and Management)</h2><p><i>Achieving Excellence in Fundraising</i> is the go-to reference for fundraising principles, concepts, and techniques.

And as they grieve over what they&#x2019;ve lost, they discover how much is still possible if only they can unravel the secret Annie left them. . . .<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Annie Freeman&#x2019;s Fabulous Traveling Funeral</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Radish&#x2019;s characters help readers realize they are not alone in the world and their struggles have been or will be experienced by other women.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Albuquerque Journal<br></i></b><br>&#x201c;Radish sings the praises of sisterhood by creating an enticing world of women helping women to become the empowered individuals they were meant to be.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Booklist</i><br></b></p><p>Kris Radish is the bestselling author of four novels, <b>The Elegant Gathering of White Snows</b><i>, </i><b>Dancing Naked at the Edge of Dawn, Annie Freeman&#x2019;s Fabulous Traveling Funeral,</b><i> </i>and<i> </i><b>The Sunday List of Dreams</b><i>. </i>She lives in Wisconsin, where she writes two nationally syndicated columns each week and is at work on her sixth novel, <i>The Poetry of Emma&#x2019;s Salvation</i>.<i>Chapter One<br></i><br><br> There is a hole the size of a golf ball in the right side of Katherine Givins&#x2019;s black Bali bra.<br><br> This is the one article of clothing that has made her feel sexy for the past 3.6 years in a row, and even though the straps lie at half-mast on her fine shoulders, the elastic exploded last summer and the hooks have been pulled so many times she has actually used a needle-nose pliers on them, Katherine cannot bear to throw the bra away.<br><br> &#x201c;Shit,&#x201d; she says, turning into the mirror and then leaning so her nose practically touches the glass to make certain there really is a hole. It&#x2019;s there, and getting wider every second, as she puts her finger in the middle and realizes that one wrong move could explode all of the seams and send her breasts into orbit.<br><br> Just as she grabs them and begins laughing hysterically at the long-held notion that the bra, like her lost marriage and her fabulous mother and the man she thought she loved two men ago or even the one she loves now, would last forever, the doorbell rings and makes her scream herself back into reality.<br><br> Her scream, the kind you might make when something normal&#x2014;like a doorbell&#x2014;flushes you from a very far-away place&#x2014;reaches the UPS woman on the front step who is glad as hell that someone is home so she doesn&#x2019;t have to leave a note and come back the next day. In the UPS world, screams, especially those coming from anywhere in front of the brown trucks and not under the rear wheels, are very good signs. So the UPS woman waits.<br><br> Katherine does not care who is at the door immediately because she is already in mourning about the loss of her bra. The bra that held her up and saw her through when her daughter announced that she had her first kiss (3.1 years ago) and then snapped the back of her mother&#x2019;s Bali bra instead of performing the regulation high-five; when she found out her ex-husband Michael was about to be married (2.8 years ago) as she was sorting wash and the bra moved from her fingers and into the black depths of a dark load; when finally a man emboldened by vodka martinis put his hand down her strategically placed low-cut sweater and ran his fingers very slowly past the elastic top and curved his hand around her left breast; when her father came to her one night (2.1 years ago) and said that he could no longer care for his wife, her mother, and could Katherine &#x201c;please, please, please&#x201d; help him find the right place, and then leaned into her, clutched her shoulder, his sad and tired arm thumping against the metal hook; when she let Alex finally make love to her (1.8 years ago) and he turned her around, lifted her blouse and took his sweet, sexy and fabulous time unhooking the Bali and then replaced it with hands that spoke seventeen languages; when she leaned over her mother&#x2019;s coffin (.8 years ago), the metal from the underwire tapping against the edge of the coffin as she ran her hands through her mother&#x2019;s hair one last time and then wept so long and hard that the funeral started almost an hour late, and just now the hole emerging like an omen of age and change slapping her upside the head and making her wonder, &#x201c;What next? What in the hell is going to happen next in this life of mine?&#x201d;<br><br> The doorbell.<br><br> Katherine, angry at the unseen intruder who had startled her, miffed about the meaning behind her disintegrating bra, and half-naked, lunges for the door as the terrified blonde woman drenched in brown is reaching for the doorbell for the third time.<br><br> &#x201c;Jesus!&#x201d; she shouts as Katherine falls into her arms the very moment the door opens.<br><br> Katherine, still angry about the intrusion, has managed to grab a kitchen towel on her run from the bedroom. It is a small towel but a towel it is and when she falls into the arms of the UPS woman the towel drops and they both watch it descend to the floor as if it may break and shatter the instant it touches earth.<br><br> Anyone lucky enough to be watching would be breathless. What next? Who will move first? Will the UPS woman find this incident funny or humiliating? Will Katherine begin screaming again? And the package . . . what in the hell is in the package?<br><br> The UPS woman, who just happens to be a kind and gentle soul who lives alone and keeps notes on all of her customers, has her arms wrapped around Katherine to steady herself. Katherine has a brief moment of clarity when she feels the warm fingers of the woman on her shoulders and this resurrects a historic moment in her mind.<br><br> She remembers that her friend Reva took her shopping the day she bought the bra. Reva stood in the center of an old-fashioned department store, hands on hips, moving from foot to foot, and said that her mother had sold bras door-to-door in rural Nevada and it was a simple gift that a woman could give to herself&#x2014;the proper fitting of a bra. This was said to Katherine P. Givins, attorney at law, who had purchased every undergarment in her entire life on the fly, cups too small, elastic tight against her back, tiny dents under her rib cage from wires that should never have been put into women&#x2019;s clothing in the first place.<br><br> And then, the moment the saleswoman fitted her&#x2014;the measuring tape sliding to the floor, her aging fingers gently lifting her breasts into this bra&#x2014;this very exceptional bra&#x2014;and the look on the older woman&#x2019;s face, a look of kind satisfaction, as she watched Katherine move and realize that &#x201c;Yes, damn it, a good bra can change everything.&#x201d;<br><br> Their eyes meet then. The UPS woman asking with her soft green eyes what she should do next, and Katherine, not moving away, holding her there, for one, two, three seconds while she lets go&#x2014;just lets go.<br><br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the bra,&#x201d; she tells Ms. UPS. &#x201c;Have you ever had a bra that has taken you through so much and held you in place like nothing else?&#x201d;<br><br> The UPS woman, who was a woman way before she was UPS, does not flinch. More than once in her twenty-six-year career, a man has answered the door naked. She has walked in on clowns dancing on tables, a wife throwing meatballs at her husband&#x2019;s favorite television show, and so many drunk people she cannot even begin to remember them all. Katherine in her favorite bra, holding her in her bra on the porch, is nothing.<br><br> &#x201c;I love jogging bras,&#x201d; the UPS woman begins. &#x201c;In my business there is quite a lot of bouncing and jumping and although I am far from voluptuous, I need a good, solid foundation for the kind of work I do.&#x201d;<br><br> Katherine falls right into the conversation, wearing her favorite undergarment, a pair of faded green cotton shorts that have another story to tell, and absolutely nothing else. The UPS woman, with more than a hint of subtle and gracious poise, motions for Katherine to step back inside of the house, but the women do not stop talking. They dance backwards and Katherine, hands flailing idly as they always do when she is excited, continues to talk about the demise of her Bali.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, how about just getting a new one?&#x201d; Ms. UPS asks.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve written and called and stopped at every department store in the United States and in three foreign countries. They do not make this bra anymore.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;How sad is that.&#x201d;<br><br> Katherine, who is usually gracious and poised herself, has this ridiculous urge to invite the UPS woman into the kitchen for a glass of wine or a cup of coffee so they can talk about undergarments all day, but she&#x2019;s also a practical and usually wise woman. She knows there&#x2019;s a good chance Ms. UPS has to finish working but she can&#x2019;t quite stop herself. Undergarments, she thinks to herself, surely do strange things to one&#x2019;s inhibitions.<br><br> Later, when days and weeks have passed and she has time to backtrack to this very moment, she will remember it as one that she should have paid more attention to when she was asking herself about why the hole in the bra was spreading now and why she was standing in her underwear in front of a stranger and why none of it seemed out of the ordinary.<br><br> &#x201c;That thing,&#x201d; she will eventually say to herself, &#x201c;that inner voice that was tapping against my heart and asking me to pause&#x2014;Damn, I should have listened. I should have paid attention because that&#x2019;s when everything changed.&#x201d;<br><br> Everything changed.<br><br> But first a wave of laughter rising from the two women who visually embrace each other as women do who can talk at the ring of a doorbell about underwear, and breasts and menstrual cycles and the way women connect and can fall into each other&#x2019;s lives and arms so quickly.<br><br> &#x201c;This must seem ridiculous,&#x201d; Katherine says as the two women tip their heads and the sound of their laughter mixes and rises to the edge of high windows in Katherine&#x2019;s very old but lovely home.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, as you can imagine, I&#x2019;ve seen everything. I&#x2019;d much rather be greeted by a woman in a black bra who has a great story than a man in black underwear who has no story at all.&#x201d;<br><br> Then Ms. UPS reaches inside of her brown pants pocket and she pulls out a small, soft stone that has been worn smooth and shiny by one ride after another inside the cotton pants pocket.<br><br> &#x201c;You have a lucky bra, something that I imagine has carried you through some challenging and tough nights and days, and I have this rock.&#x201d;<br><br> She lets Katherine take the rock into her hand and feel how just holding it, like wearing a fabulous bra, can be a comfort. They don&#x2019;t talk about it because they are women and they know. They know about comfort and the loss of it and they know about sacrifice and change and that the ring of a doorbell, a wild call at midnight, the scent of something new, the touch of a baby or a lover&#x2019;s fresh face, can change everything.<br><br> They know.<br><br> &#x201c;I see,&#x201d; Katherine says and then she gently hands back the stone, understanding its importance, but also not able to stop herself from saying, &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll understand if I don&#x2019;t hand over the bra.&#x201d;<br><br> They laugh, which is the perfect thing to do, and then Ms. UPS says, &#x201c;The package!&#x201d; and goes back to the front door where she set down her clipboard and the box, wrapped in the requisite brown paper with one single and simple label.<br><br> &#x201c;This is for you if you are indeed Katherine P. Givins.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I am.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Expecting this?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have no clue.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Well, this is your surprise and you were mine then,&#x201d; Ms. UPS says, smiling as she dips to pick up her sign-off sheet.<br><br> Katherine signs the metal-backed ledger and then Ms. UPS bends to pick up the box. The transfer is swift and easy and the package passes from woman to woman in a ceremony that is completed only when Katherine, who has always been way to the other side of spontaneous, bends to hug Ms. UPS one last time.<br><br> &#x201c;You are a sweetheart,&#x201d; she tells her new blonde friend.<br><br> &#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s nice but it&#x2019;s all part of the job. I never know what is going to happen or what I might see when I ring someone&#x2019;s doorbell.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I imagine you&#x2019;ve seen more action than a pile of undergarments,&#x201d; Katherine says and then pauses for a second. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s something new and exciting behind every unopened door.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Sounds like a book title,&#x201d; Ms. UPS responds just before she turns back toward her waiting van. &#x201c;Time to go see what&#x2019;s behind the next door.&#x201d;<br><br> There is a quick wave and then Katherine finds herself alone in the foyer of the home she has spent twelve years restoring. The home she bought with the proceeds from her first fairly huge lawsuit, which netted her $69,283 and allowed her to move from a two-bedroom apartment with her daughter Sonya following her divorce from a man whom she had once loved a great deal but had come to realize she should have never married for a variety of reasons including the not-so-obvious fact that he had never gotten over the love of his life&#x2014;a woman he still saw three times a week at places like hotels, nice restaurants, and the back seat of her husband&#x2019;s car.<br><br> The package.<br><br> Ms. UPS is stepping into the brown van when Katherine looks for just a second at the package that is wedged against her own chest, just where the Bali touches the top of her last rib, and wonders if the shape of the box does not hint that there may be a pair of shoes inside. Her mind stops there as Ms. UPS turns, shouts, &#x201c;Bye now,&#x201d; smiles as if she knows a wild secret and then disappears behind a sliding door that sounds like a smooth and even gunshot.<br><br> The door closes as Katherine turns to tap it with her heel, because ever since she has owned the home that is what she does to make certain that it really is closed, and when she turns she can see her reflection in the oak mirror by the door. She sees the bra hole&#x2014;which is now wider than a golf ball, maybe even a tennis ball&#x2014;widen to the shape of an almost ripe grapefruit.<br><br> &#x201c;Damn it,&#x201d; she says, even though she is not prone to swearing and loathes the societal turn of events that makes a word like &#x201c;fuck&#x201d; commonplace. &#x201c;Just damn it.&#x201d;<br><br> The package is wedged under her bra and Katherine does not realize that it is the package that is now holding the bra in place. She does not see that there is a dwindling span of threads the size of three toothpicks that is holding together the left side of her bra and that the minute she sits or moves too fast the bra will fly open and be lost to her forever. She doesn&#x2019;t see this but she is thinking about it. She is thinking about the miles of highway that the bra has seen her over and the heartaches and the laughs and then, because she harbors a secret, a very old and almost forgotten desire to write children&#x2019;s books, she wonders if anyone has ever written a story about a girl&#x2019;s first bra. She is also thinking about the mysterious box and the who, what, when, where and why of its existence.<br><br> Katherine settles into the rocking chair just beyond the edge of the front hall, the box pushed tight against her chest, and rocks for one, two, three minutes wondering if Ms. UPS will race home and call someone to tell the story of the wild woman with the ancient bra who answered the door just past noon.<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; she answers herself the same way we all speak when we are alone or working and need to just hear a word so we can validate our own precious thought. &#x201c;This probably happens all of the time.&#x201d;<br><br> She imagines then just for a few moments what it would be like if she had the UPS woman&#x2019;s life or anyone else&#x2019;s life but her own. She wonders about delivering packages with unknown contents instead of drafting law briefs; she wonders about changing an entire career just like that, like the snap of a bra, for something new and maybe not so ferocious and seemingly arbitrary like distributing little pieces of the law. She wonders about skipping a beat, about missing an appointment, about maybe running down the road naked or doing something impractical like not even wear- ing a bra anymore. Something. Anything. She wonders and as she wonders she is astonished to realize she is tired. Physically tired and mentally tired. Tired of routines and all the expectations of her own life that she has so carefully designed and now scrambles daily to keep in place like one of those ridiculous plate-balancing acts at the circus.<br><br> Then it is time for the package.<br><br> Wrapped in a brown paper bag that has been cut with scissors and then taped so the edges touch perfectly. A package that comes to Katherine&#x2019;s house on a Wednesday when she is rarely, if ever, home, but because of a scheduling mix-up and a sick clerk and the desire to breathe in some rare quiet for just a few hours, Katherine, who considers herself beyond predictable and north of reliable, slips from her assistant district attorney&#x2019;s job and into her favorite nasty clothes, in which she expects to read a pile of old magazines until her daughter comes home for dinner from her third year of high school, track practice and a S...</p><h2>The Acquirer&#39;s Multiple: How the Billionaire Contrarians of Deep Value Beat the Market</h2><p>The Acquirer&#x2019;s Multiple: How the Billionaire Contrarians of Deep Value Beat the Market is an easy-to-read account of deep value investing.

This volume explores the meaning and importance of food sovereignty for Native peoples in the United States, and asks whether and how it might be achieved and sustained.<br><br> Unprecedented in its focus and scope, this collection addresses nearly every aspect of indigenous food sovereignty, from revitalizing ancestral gardens and traditional ways of hunting, gathering, and seed saving to the difficult realities of racism, treaty abrogation, tribal sociopolitical factionalism, and the entrenched beliefs that processed foods are superior to traditional tribal fare. The contributors include scholar-activists in the fields of ethnobotany, history, anthropology, nutrition, insect ecology, biology, marine environmentalism, and federal Indian law, as well as indigenous seed savers and keepers, cooks, farmers, spearfishers, and community activists. After identifying the challenges involved in revitalizing and maintaining traditional food systems, these writers offer advice and encouragement to those concerned about tribal health, environmental destruction, loss of species habitat, and governmental food control.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</p><p><p><b>Devon A.

Ranging from strategy to public relations, from finance to organization, Gerstner reveals the lessons of a lifetime running highly successful companies.</p><p><p>Lou Gerstner, Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 until March 2002, when he retired as CEO. He remained chairman of the board through the end of 2002. Before joining IBM, Mr. Gerstner served for four years as chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, Inc. This was preceded by an eleven-year career at the American Express Company, where he was president of the parent company and chairman and CEO of its largest subsidiary. Prior to that, Mr. Gerstner was a director of the management consulting firm of McKinsey &amp; Co., Inc. He received a bachelor's degree in engineering from Dartmouth College and an MBA from Harvard Business School.</p>The former CEO of IBM tells the story of his company's amazing comeback from 1993 to 2001. Challenged by customers and employees worldwide and product-service lines that defied integration, Gerstner implemented solutions to turn the company into the integrated business giant it is today. Edward Herrmann's pacing and understated connection with the material in this memoir makes the audio seem compact and relaxed. The writing is also outstanding, lacking excessive pride or self-congratulation, so you don't have to elbow past the author's ego to absorb the many CEO-level insights offered here.

Hatched from eggs smaller than a baseball, some can grow to weigh over a thousand pounds. Once adults, they can live to be around 100 years old. And when it's time to nest, they migrate more than 1,000 miles.&nbsp;<br><br>With colorful, clear illustrations and straightforward text, Gail Gibbons introduces the eight kinds of sea turtles living in the ocean today. Learn the similarities and differences with labeled diagrams and experience the hatching of the tiny turtle babies with detailed illustrations. This updated edition now includes the most up-to-date information about these beloved reptiles, as reviewed by an expert vetter in the field of herpetology.<br><br>Sea Turtles also gives young readers an accessible overview of how the lives of these large reptiles have become threatened and discusses the conservation efforts currently taking place. Ideal for aspiring oceanographers, this brightly-illustrated book is a perfect introduction to the subject.</p><p>According to <i>The Washington Post</i>, Gail Gibbons "has taught more preschoolers and early readers about the world than any other children's writer-illustrator." The multi award-winning Ms. Gibbons is the author of more than 100 books for young readers, including the bestselling titles <i>From Seed to Plant</i> and <i>Monarch Butterfl</i>y. Her many honors include the Regina Medal, the Washington Post/Children's Book Guild Nonfiction Award and the NSTA Outstanding Science Trade Book Award.Grade 1-3-Soft watercolor illustrations amplify brief descriptions of the eight species of sea turtles. Unique characteristics are described in a few carefully chosen words, and the pictures draw readers into the creatures' underwater world. Differences in color, size, shell, etc. are clearly defined. Many pages are devoted to the similarities in the species' reproductive behavior. One double-page spread covers the differences between the more familiar and the seldom seen sea turtles. This book does not provide in-depth coverage; how the creatures breathe when at sea or why their populations have declined by half over the last 20 years are not explained. However, it is an inviting look at how these ancient reptiles live, reproduce, and grow, and at the environmental changes that threaten their existence.<br><i>Frances E.

As a commander in charge of over 200 recruits and 16 drill instructors at Parris Island, South Carolina, Robin learned the fundamentals of leadership and influence. Upon entering service in the FBI in 1997, Robin began his journey as a behaviorist in the agency's efforts to thwart the effort of our country's adversaries. Throughout his life, Robin has received advanced training and experience in the area of social psychology and the practical application of the science behind relationship development. Robin's remarkable journey began as a 1992 graduate of the United States Naval Academy and former U. S. Marine Corps Officer. He has studied interpersonal relations for the past 27 years of his government service. Through observations of nonverbal behavior, use of the Personal Discernment Inventory, the Myers Briggs Type Indicator, and his own unique techniques, Robin has built highly effective tools for all aspects and stages of interpersonal communication. Robin has combined all these tools and techniques and created a one-of-a-kind formula for success with people. Today, Robin is a recognized expert, author, and gifted lecturer in the art of interpersonal communication. These skills are used every day in leadership, sales, human resources, and all relationships, both business and personal. <br><br>Disclaimer: The views and information expressed do not represent the views of the FBI.</p><h2>A Widow&#39;s Guide to Healing: Gentle Support and Advice for the First 5 Years</h2><p><p><strong>An inspiring, accessible, and empowering guide for how to navigate the unique grief and challenges of widowhood and create a hopeful future.</strong></p><p>When Kristin Meekhof lost her husband to cancer, she discovered what all widows learn: the moment you lose your partner, you must make crucial decisions that will impact the rest of your life.

He is both more primitive and more cultured, more destructive and more constructive, occasionally crazier and yet adamantly saner, than the average person.</p><p>&#x2014;FRANK X. BARRON, PSYCHOLOGIST AND CREATIVITY RESEARCHER</p><p>Several years ago, Scott gave a popular science rapper an extensive battery of personality tests. At the time, this Canadian entertainer, known as Baba Brinkman,1 was starring in an Off-Broadway show called <i>The Rap Guide to Evolution</i>, a hip-hop tribute to Charles Darwin and the theory of natural selection. In the show, an animated Brinkman jumps energetically onstage, drops rhymes such as &#x201c;The weak and the strong, who got it goin&#x2019; on? We lived in the dark for so long,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Getting pregnant before marriage; it&#x2019;s such a tragedy. Apparently it&#x2019;s also a reproductive strategy.&#x201d; He was one of the most bold and magnetic performers Scott had ever witnessed on the stage.</p><p>Brinkman&#x2019;s test results were perplexing, revealing a personality riddled with contradictions. On the one hand, Scott noticed that Brinkman scored high in &#x201c;blirtatiousness&#x201d;&#x2014;a personality trait characterized by the tendency to say whatever is on one&#x2019;s mind. But at the same time, Brinkman didn&#x2019;t seem extraverted offstage.</p><p>He then found that while Brinkman scored high in assertiveness&#x2014;one hallmark of extraverted personalities&#x2014;he was only slightly above average in enthusiasm, another big marker of extraversion.2 How could this charismatic performer, who seemed so full of energy, be only slightly above average in expressiveness behind the curtain? Scott dug deeper into the data to try to make sense of Brinkman&#x2019;s puzzling personality.</p><p>&#x201c;I get that remark all the time with people who hang out with me after the show,&#x201d; Brinkman told Scott. &#x201c;They say, &#x2018;You&#x2019;re so quiet, what happened to the guy onstage?&#x2019; I get in front of a crowd, I get charged up, and it&#x2019;s like &#x2018;I&#x2019;m gonna get everybody into this.&#x2019; There has become this huge split, where I&#x2019;m quite a temperate personality most of the time until I get on a stage and have a job to do, and then it&#x2019;s like <i>bam</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>As Scott delved deeper into Brinkman&#x2019;s psyche, further paradoxes emerged. For one, he noticed that Brinkman was low in narcissism&#x2014;a trait that can be rampant among performers (and often rappers in particular). However, Brinkman <i>did</i> possess some of the individual qualities that together make up narcissism. Brinkman scored high in exhibitionism and superiority&#x2014;two aspects of narcissism that had likely proved helpful to his career as an entertainer&#x2014;while scoring low in the exploitativeness and entitlement aspects of narcissism. Brinkman also scored high in several positive characteristics that were undoubtedly beneficial to his career in music: emotional intelligence, social awareness, and the ability to manage stress. Scott noticed too that Brinkman was simultaneously oriented toward short-term romantic affairs while demonstrating a strong ability to sustain relationships.</p><p>Brinkman&#x2019;s personality was a case study in one of the most well-known findings in the history of creativity research: <i>Creative people have messy minds</i>.</p><p>Creative people also tend to have messy processes.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Picasso went through a rather chaotic process in creating his most famous painting, <i>Guernica</i>.</p><p>After being asked to create a mural for the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 World&#x2019;s Fair, the painter found himself spinning his wheels for three months while he searched for creative inspiration. Then, inspiration struck alongside tragedy. In the wake of the Nazis&#x2019; bombing of a small Basque town at the behest of the Spanish Nationalist forces, Picasso set out to illustrate the atrocities of Spain&#x2019;s bloody civil war.</p><p>Just fifteen days after the bombing, Picasso went to work on a series of forty-five numbered sketches. He painstakingly drew numerous versions of each of the figures that would appear in the painting&#x2014;the bull, the horse, the warrior, the woman crying, the mother with her dead child&#x2014;before touching a single drop of oil to the eleven- by twenty-five-foot canvas on which he would paint the mural.</p><p>For each figure, Picasso sketched a diverse set of variations. These sketches often did not exhibit a clear upward progression. In several cases, the figure he selected to appear in the finished painting ended up being one of the earliest he had sketched. The figure of the mother with her dead child featured in the final work, which depicted the mother holding the child in her arms and weeping, was very similar to the first two versions he sketched. But then, he went on to create two images that were wildly different&#x2014;instead of the mother holding the child in her arms (as she appears in the painting) the discarded sketches show the mother carrying her child up a ladder. Picasso continued his experimentation with new figures even after moving on to the canvas, which often required him to paint over what was already there. He also explored a number of creative possibilities, such as a bull with a human head, that he ultimately didn&#x2019;t pursue.</p><p>Although Picasso was a seasoned painter who had been creating masterpieces for decades by the time he took on the project, his process in painting <i>Guernica </i>appeared to be more chaotic than controlled, more spontaneous than linear. The surplus of ideas and sketches that Picasso produced did not show a clear progression toward the final painting. The process was characterized by a number of false starts, and as some art historians have noted, many of the sketches he drew appear to be superfluous to the final product.3</p><p>Exploration and seemingly blind experimentation were key to Picasso&#x2019;s creative process. Rather than creating a painting to reflect his own preexisting worldview, he seemed to actively build and reshape that worldview through the creative process. While he may have had a rough intuition, it&#x2019;s likely that Picasso did not quite know where he was going, creatively, until he arrived there.4</p><p>Picasso said of his own creative process, &#x201c;A painting is not thought out and settled in advance. While it is being done, it changes as one&#x2019;s thoughts change. And when it&#x2019;s finished, it goes on changing, according to the state of mind of whoever is looking at it.&#x201d;</p><p>The progression of Picasso&#x2019;s <i>Guernica</i> sketches offers a fascinating glimpse into his imagination, but it raises as many questions as it offers answers. To what extent did the painter have even the slightest idea what he was doing? And if he didn&#x2019;t know what he was doing, then how are we to make sense of his creative process&#x2014;or of the creative process more generally?</p><p>Attempting to analyze Picasso&#x2019;s personality offers little in terms of answers. The painter was a protean shapeshifter as both artist and man; he has been described as a difficult personality,5 who was intensely passionate and deeply cynical; &#x201c;a towering creative genius one moment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a sadistic manipulator the next.&#x201d;6 Picasso himself hinted at these paradoxes in his life and work when he said, &#x201c;I am always doing that which I cannot do,&#x201d; and described the act of creation as one of destruction.7</p><p>So how are we to make sense of the complex creative process and personality? It starts with embracing a very messy set of contradictions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction: Messy Minds</p><p>Do I contradict myself? Very well, then I contradict myself, I am large, I contain multitudes.</p><p>&#x2014;WALT WHITMAN</p><p>The debate over the creation of <i>Guernica</i> reflects a much larger schism in our understanding of the creative mind.</p><p>The history of scientific thinking about creativity has been defined by polarization, starting with a popular 1926 theory of the creative process that set the stage for decades&#x2019; worth of debate among psychologists.</p><p>In his book <i>The Art of Thought,</i> British social psychologist Graham Wallas outlined the popular &#x201c;four-stage model&#x201d; of creativity. After observing and studying accounts of eminent inventors and creators, Wallas proposed that the creative process involves the following stages: <i>preparation</i>, during which the creator acquires as much information as possible about a problem; <i>incubation</i>, during which the creator lets the knowledge stew as the unconscious mind takes over and engages in what Einstein referred to as &#x201c;combinatory play&#x201d;;1 <i>illumination</i>, during which an insight arises in consciousness&#x2014;the natural culmination of a &#x201c;successful train of association&#x201d;; and a <i>verification stage</i>, during which the creator fleshes out the insights, and communicates their value to others.2</p><p>If only the creative process was so tidy. While psychologists continue to vigorously debate its workings, most agree that the traditional four-stage model is far too simplistic.3 In his presidential address to the American Psychological Association in 1950, J. P. Guilford made a bold call for psychologists to take a closer look at creativity. He rejected the four-stage model, calling it &#x201c;very superficial from a psychological point of view,&#x201d;4 because it tells us so little about the mental processes occurring during the act of creation.</p><p>As psychologists continued to put artists under the microscope to examine the creative process in action, they continued to find it to be far from a clear-cut, step-by-step process.5 Further research showed creative people to engage in rapid switching of thought processes and to exhibit nearly simultaneous coexistence between a number of these processes, from generating new ideas to expanding and working out the ideas, to critical reflection, to taking a distance from one&#x2019;s work and considering the perspective of the audience.</p><p>These processes, of course, differ from one type of artist to another. When creating fiction, writers tend to exhibit a complex process of their own. Research conducted on a group of novelists painted a picture of the fiction-writing process as a &#x201c;voyage of discovery&#x201d; that begins with a <i>seed incident</i>&#x2014;an event or observation that inspires fascination and exploration and becomes the fertile ground on which creative growth occurs. Seed incidents tend to break the mind out of ordinary understanding and create new meanings for the writer, as evidenced by the writers&#x2019; descriptions of these events as &#x201c;touching,&#x201d; &#x201c;intriguing,&#x201d; &#x201c;puzzling,&#x201d; &#x201c;mysterious,&#x201d; &#x201c;haunting,&#x201d; and &#x201c;overwhelming.&#x201d; Commenting on a family incident that became the seed for a story, one writer said that the event seemed &#x201c;full of meanings I couldn&#x2019;t even begin to grasp.&#x201d;6</p><p>The seed incident is followed by a period of navigation between different creative worlds. At this stage, the writers oscillated between the &#x201c;writingrealm&#x201d;&#x2014;a place of retreat from the world where the writer can plan and reflect on what has been written&#x2014;and the &#x201c;fictionworld&#x201d; of their own making: an imaginative place in which the author engages with fiction characters and events as they unfold. For instance, after one writer began her story with the line &#x201c;I am a poodle,&#x201d; she imaginatively transformed herself into a dog, &#x201c;allowing the sounds and sights and smells of a dog&#x2019;s world to come to her.&#x201d; She then switches mental gears, returning to the writingrealm to reflectively evaluate and improve upon what she had written. This fictionworld, which consists of imagination and fantasy, is a distinctly different realm of experience from the writingrealm, where reflective thinking and rational deliberation occur. This constant toggling between imaginative and rational ways of thinking suggests a more complex, less linear account of fiction writing than the four-stage model can accommodate.</p><p>Further analyses of creative writers continued to reject a step-by-step account of the creative process, suggesting that writing is likely to be considerably less controlled. Focusing on the contemporary novelist&#x2019;s search for meaning and struggle to express a specific experience,7 another study emphasized that the writing process often moves forward even without the novelist&#x2019;s full understanding of where the work is going. As the writer slowly gains a sense of the direction in which he is moving, he can begin to move forward deliberately and with greater clarity. The process reflects what <i>Calvin and Hobbes</i> creator Bill Watterson said of creativity and life, &#x201c;The truth is, most of us discover where we are headed when we arrive.&#x201d;8</p><p>Psychologist Dean Keith Simonton, who has extensively studied the career trajectories of creative geniuses across the arts, sciences, humanities, and leadership, came to a strikingly similar conclusion. Based on a detailed case study of Thomas Edison&#x2019;s creative career, Simonton suggested that even at the level of genius, creativity is a &#x201c;messy business.&#x201d;9</p><p>Even at the level of genius, creativity is a &#x201c;messy business.&#x201d;</p><p>Given the complex and ever-changing nature of the creative process, it should come as little surprise that creative people tend to have messy minds. Highly creative work blends together different elements and influences in the most novel, or unusual, way, and these wide-ranging states, traits, and behaviors frequently conflict with each other within the mind of the creative person, resulting in a great deal of internal and external tension throughout the creative process.10</p><p>One of the most fascinating things about creative work is that it brings together and harmonizes these conflicting elements, which exist to some extent in everyone. Creative people are hubs of diverse interests, influences, behaviors, qualities, and ideas&#x2014;and through their work, they find a way to bring these many disparate elements together. This is one of the reasons why creativity feels so ineffable&#x2014;it is so many different things at the same time! After interviewing creative people across various fields for over thirty years, the eminent psychologist of creativity Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi observed: &#x201c;If I had to express in one word what makes their personalities different from others, it&#x2019;s <i>complexity</i>. They show tendencies of thought and action that in most people are segregated. They contain contradictory extremes; instead of being an &#x2018;individual,&#x2019; each of them is a &#x2018;multitude.&#x2019;&#x201d;11</p><p>Case in point: The brilliant journalist David Carr&#x2014;a creature of many contradictions and a protean shapeshifter if there ever was one&#x2014;said that he often reflected upon the many &#x201c;selves&#x201d; that he had possessed over his lifetime, from drug addict to media celebrity. &#x201c;I spent time looking into my past to decide which of my selves I made up&#x2014;the thug or the nice family man&#x2014;and the answer turned out to be neither,&#x201d; he reflected. &#x201c;Whitman was right. We contain multitudes.&#x201d;</p><p>Another prototype of the messy creative mind is the iconic Jazz Age entertainer Josephine Baker.

Her aunt goes away on business soon after Daisy arrives. The next day bombs go off as London is attacked and occupied by an unnamed enemy.<br><br>As power fails, and systems fail, the farm becomes more isolated. Despite the war, it&#x2019;s a kind of Eden, with no adults in charge and no rules, a place where Daisy&#x2019;s uncanny bond with her cousins grows into something rare and extraordinary. But the war is everywhere, and Daisy and her cousins must lead each other into a world that is unknown in the scariest, most elemental way.<br><br>A riveting and astonishing story.</p><p>Possibly one of the most talked about books of the year, Meg Rosoff's novel for young adults is the winner of the Guardian Children's Fiction Prize 2004. Heralded by some as the next best adult crossover novel since Mark Haddon's <i>The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time</i>, who himself has given the book a thunderously good quote, this author's debut is undoubtedly stylish, readable and fascinating.<p> Rosoff's story begins in modern day London, slightly in the future, and as its heroine has a 15-year-old Manhattanite called Daisy. She's picked up at the airport by Edmond, her English cousin, a boy in whose life she is destined to become intricately entwined. Daisy stays at her Aunt Penn's country farmhouse for the summer with Edmond and her other cousins. They spend some idyllic weeks together--often alone with Aunt Penn away travelling in Norway. Daisy's cousins seem to have an almost telepathic bond, and Daisy is mesmerized by Edmond and soon falls in love with him.</p><p> But their world changes forever when an unnamed aggressor invades England and begins a years-long occupation. Daisy and Edmond are separated when soldiers take over their home, and Daisy and Piper, her younger cousin, must travel to another place to work. Their experiences of occupation are never kind and Daisy's pain, living without Edmond, is tangible.</p><p> Rosoff's writing style is both brilliant and frustrating. Her descriptions are wonderful, as is her ability to portray the emotions of her characters. However, her long sentences and total lack of punctuation for dialogue can be exhausting. Her narrative is deeply engaging and yet a bit unbelievable. The end of the book is dramatic, but too sudden. The book has a raw, unfinished feel about it, yet that somehow adds to the experience of reading it. (Age 14 and over) --<i>John McLay</i></p>This is <b>Meg Rosoff</b>&#x2019;s first novel.

Ever finish eating a bag of French fries even though they were cold, limp, and soggy? It hurts to answer questions like these.<br><br>Why do we overeat food that doesn&#x2019;t even taste good?<br><br>We overeat because there are signals and cues around us that tell us to eat. It&#x2019;s simply not in our nature to pause after every bite and contemplate whether we&#x2019;re full. As we eat, we unknowingly&#x2013;mindlessly&#x2013;look for signals or cues that we&#x2019;ve had enough. For instance, if there&#x2019;s nothing remaining on the table, that&#x2019;s a cue that it&#x2019;s time to stop. If everyone else has left the table, turned off the lights, and we&#x2019;re sitting alone in the dark, that&#x2019;s another cue. For many of us, as long as there are still a few milk-soaked Fruit Loops left in the bottom of the cereal bowl, there is still work to be done. It doesn&#x2019;t matter if we&#x2019;re full, and it doesn&#x2019;t matter if we don&#x2019;t even really like Fruit Loops. We eat as if it is our mission to finish them.<br>Stale Popcorn and Frail Willpower<br>Take movie popcorn, for instance. There is no &#x201c;right&#x201d; amount of popcorn to eat during a movie. There are no rules of thumb or FDA guidelines. People eat however much they want depending on how hungry they are and how good it tastes. At least that&#x2019;s what they say.<br><br>My graduate students and I think different. We think that the cues around us&#x2013;like the size of a popcorn bucket&#x2013;can provide subtle but powerful suggestions about how much one should eat. These cues can short-circuit a person&#x2019;s hunger and taste signals, leading them to eat even if they&#x2019;re not hungry and even if the food doesn&#x2019;t taste very good.<br><br>If you were living in Chicago a few years back, you might have been our guest at a suburban theater matinee. If you lined up to see the 1:05 p.m. Saturday showing of Mel Gibson&#x2019;s new action movie, <i>Payback</i>, you would have had a surprise waiting for you: a free bucket of popcorn.<br><br>Every person who bought a ticket&#x2013;even though many of them had just eaten lunch&#x2013;was given a soft drink and either a medium-size bucket of popcorn or a large-size, bigger-than-your-head bucket. They were told that the popcorn and soft drinks were free and that we hoped they would be willing to answer a few concession stand-related questions after the movie.<br><br>There was only one catch. This wasn&#x2019;t fresh popcorn. Unknown to the moviegoers and even to my graduate students, this popcorn had been popped five days earlier and stored in sterile conditions until it was stale enough to squeak when it was eaten.<br><br>To make sure it was kept separate from the rest of the theater popcorn, it was transported to the theater in bright yellow garbage bags&#x2013;the color yellow that screams &#x201c;Biohazard.&#x201d; The popcorn was safe to eat, but it was stale enough one moviegoer said it was like eating Styrofoam packing peanuts. Two others, forgetting they had been given it for free, asked for their money back. During the movie, people would eat a couple bites, put the bucket down, pick it up again a few minutes later and have a couple more bites, put it back down, and continue. It might not have been good enough to eat all at once, but they couldn&#x2019;t leave it alone.<br><br>Both popcorn containers&#x2013;medium and large&#x2013;had been selected to be big enough that nobody could finish all the popcorn. And each person was given his or her own individual bucket so there would be no sharing.<br><br>As soon as the movie ended and the credits began to roll, we asked everyone to take their popcorn with them. We gave them a half-page survey (on bright biohazard-yellow paper) that asked whether they agreed to statements like &#x201c;I ate too much popcorn,&#x201d; by circling a number from 1 (strongly disagree) to 9 (strongly agree). As they did this, we weighed their remaining popcorn.<br><br>When the people who had been given the large buckets handed their leftover popcorn to us, we said, &#x201c;Some people tonight were given medium-size buckets of popcorn, and others, like yourself, were given these large-size buckets. We have found that the average person who is given a large-size container eats more than if they are given a medium-size container. Do you think you ate more because you had the large size?&#x201d; Most disagreed. Many smugly said, &#x201c;That wouldn&#x2019;t happen to me,&#x201d; &#x201c;Things like that don&#x2019;t trick me,&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m pretty good at knowing when I&#x2019;m full.&#x201d;<br><br>That may be what they believed, but it is not what happened.<br><br>Weighing the buckets told us that the big-bucket group people ate an average of 173 more calories of popcorn. That is roughly the equivalent of 21 more dips into the bucket. Clearly the quality of food is not what led them to eat. Once these moviegoers started in on their bucket, the taste of the popcorn didn&#x2019;t matter. Even though some of them had just had lunch, people who were given the big buckets ate an average of 53 percent more than those given medium-size buckets. Give them a lot, and they eat a lot.<br><br><i>And this was five-day-old, stale popcorn</i>!<br><br>We&#x2019;ve run other popcorn studies, and the results were always the same, however we tweaked the details. It didn&#x2019;t matter if our moviegoers were in Pennsylvania, Illinois, or Iowa, and it didn&#x2019;t matter what kind of movie was showing, all of our popcorn studies led to the same conclusion. People eat more when you give them a bigger container. Period. It doesn&#x2019;t matter whether the popcorn is fresh or fourteen days old, or whether they were hungry or full when they sat down for the movie.<br><br>Did people eat because they liked the popcorn? No. Did they eat because they were hungry? No. They ate because of all the cues around them&#x2013;not only the size of the popcorn bucket, but also other factors I&#x2019;ll discuss later, such as the distracting movie, the sound of people eating popcorn around them, and the eating scripts we take to movie theaters with us. All of these were cues that signaled it was okay to keep on eating and eating.<br><br>Does this mean we can avoid mindless eating simply by replacing large bowls with smaller bowls? That&#x2019;s one piece of the puzzle, but there are a lot more cues that can be engineered out of our lives. As you will see, these hidden persuaders can even take the form of a tasty description on a menu or a classy name on a wine bottle. Simply<i> thinking</i> that a meal will taste good can lead you to eat more. You won&#x2019;t even know it happened.<br>As Fine as North Dakota Wine<br><br>The restaurant is open only 24 nights a year and serves an inclusive prix-fixe theme dinner each night. A nice meal will cost you less than $25, but to get it you will have to phone for reservations and be seated at either 5:30 or 7:00 sharp. Despite these drawbacks, there is often a waiting list.<br><br>Welcome to the Spice Box. The Spice Box looks like a restaurant; it sounds like a restaurant; and it smells like a restaurant. To the people eating there, it <i>is</i> a restaurant. To the people working there, it&#x2019;s a fine dining lab sponsored by the Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The Spice Box is a lab where culinary hopefuls learn whether a new recipe will fly or go down in flames. It&#x2019;s a lab where waitstaff discover whether a new approach will sizzle or fizzle. It&#x2019;s also a lab where consumer psychologists have figured out what makes a person nibble a little or inhale it all.<br><br>There is a secret and imaginary line down the middle of the dining room in the Spice Box. On one Thursday, diners on the left side of the room might be getting a different version of the shrimp coconut jambalaya entr�e than those on the right. On the next Thursday, diners on the left side will be given a menu with basic English names for the food, while those on the right will be given a menu with French-sounding names. On the Thursday after that, diners on the left side will hear each entr�e described by a waiter, while those on the right will read the same descriptions off the menu. At the end of the meal, sometimes we ask the diners some short survey questions, but other times we carefully weigh how much food our guests have left on their plates. That way we don&#x2019;t have to rely on what they say, we can rely on what they do&#x2013;which version of shrimp coconut jamba- laya they polished off.<br><br>But on one dark Thursday night in the first week of February 2004, something a little more mischievous was planned for diners who braved the snow to keep their reservations. They were getting a full glass of Cabernet Sauvignon before their meal. Totally free. Compliments of the house.<br><br>This cabernet was not a fine vintage. In fact, it was a $2 bottle sold under the brand name Charles Shaw&#x2013;popularly known as Two Buck Chuck. But our diners didn&#x2019;t know this. In fact, all the Charles Shaw labels had been soaked off the bottles and replaced with professionally designed labels that were 100 percent fake.<br><br>Those on the left side of the room were being offered wine from the fictional Noah&#x2019;s Winery, a new California label. The winery&#x2019;s classic, italicized logo was enveloped by a simple graphic of grapes and vines. Below this, the wine proudly announced that it was &#x201c;NEW from California.&#x201d; After the diners arrived and were seated, the waiter or waitress said, &#x201c;Good evening and welcome to the Spice Box. As you&#x2019;re deciding what you want to eat this evening, we&#x2019;re offering you a complimentary glass of Cabernet Sauvignon. It&#x2019;s from a new California winery called Noah&#x2019;s Winery.&#x201d; Each person was then poured a standard 3.8-ounce glass of wine.<br><br>About an hour later, after they had finished their meal and were paying for it, we weighed the amount of wine left in each glass and the amount of the entr�e left on each plate. We also had a record of when each diner had started eating and when they paid their bill and left.<br><br>Diners on the right side of the room had exactly the same dining experience&#x2013;with one exception. The waiter or waitress&#x2019;s carefully scripted welcome introduced a cabernet &#x201c;from a new <i>North Dakota</i> winery called Noah&#x2019;s Winery.&#x201d; The label was identical to that on the first bottle, except for the words &#x201c;NEW from North Dakota.&#x201d;<br><br>There is no Bordeaux region in North Dakota, nor is there a Burgundy region, nor a Champagne region. There is, however, a Fargo region, a Bismarck region, and a Minot region. It&#x2019;s just that there are no wine grapes grown in any of them. California equals wine. North Dakota equals snow or buffalo.<br><br>People who were given &#x201c;North Dakota wine&#x201d; believed it was North Dakota wine. But since it <i>was</i> the same wine we poured for those who thought they were getting California wine, that shouldn&#x2019;t influence their taste. Should it?<br><br>It did. We knew from an earlier lab study that people who thought they were drinking North Dakota wine had such low expectations, they rated the wine as tasting bad <i>and</i> their food as less tasty. If a California wine label can give a glowing halo to an entire meal, a North Dakota wine label casts a shadow onto everything it touches.<br><br>But our focus that particular night was whether these labels would influence <i>how much</i> our diners ate.<br><br>After the meals were over, the first thing we discovered was that both groups of people drank about the same amount of wine&#x2013;all of it. This was not so surprising. It was only one glass of wine and it was a cold night. Where they differed was in how much food they ate and how long they lingered at their table.<br><br>Compared to those unlucky diners given wine with North Dakota labels, people who thought they had been given a free glass of California wine ate 11 percent more of their food&#x2013;19 of the 24 even cleaned their plates. They also lingered an average of 10 minutes longer at their table (64 minutes). They stayed pretty much until the waitstaff starting dropping hints that the next seating would be starting soon.<br><br>The night was not quite as magical for those given wine with the North Dakota label. Not only did they leave more food on their plates, this probably wasn&#x2019;t much of a meal to remember, because it went by so fast. North Dakota wine drinkers sat down, drank, ate, paid, and were out in 55 minutes&#x2013;less than an hour. For them, this was clearly not a special meal, it was just food.<br><br>Exact same meals, exact same wine. Different labels, different reactions.<br><br>Now, to a cold-eyed skeptic, there should have been no difference between the two groups. They should have eaten the same amount and enjoyed it the same.<br><br>They didn&#x2019;t. <i>They mindlessly ate</i>. That is, once they were given a free glass of &#x201c;California&#x201d; wine, they said to themselves: &#x201c;This is going to be good.&#x201d; Once they concluded it was going to be good, their experience lined up to confirm their expectations. They no longer had to stop and think about whether the food and wine were really as good as they thought. They had already decided.<br><br>Of course, the same thing happened to the diners who were given the &#x201c;North Dakota&#x201d; wine. Once they saw the label, they set themselves up for disappointment. There was no halo; there was a shadow. And not only was the wine bad, the entire meal fell short.<br><br>After our studies are over, we &#x201c;debrief&#x201d; people&#x2013;often by e-mail&#x2013;and tell them what the study was about and what results we expect. For instance, with our different wine studies, we might say, &#x201c;We think the average person drinking what they believe is North Dakota wine will like their meal less than those given the &#x2018;California&#x2019; wine.&#x201d; We then ask the kicker: &#x201c;Do you think you were influenced by the state&#x2019;s name you saw on the label?&#x201d; Almost all will give the exact same answer: &#x201c;No, I wasn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>In the thousands of debriefings we&#x2019;ve done for hundreds of studies, nearly every person who was &#x201c;tricked&#x201d; by the words on a label, the size of a package, the lighting in a room, or the size of a plate said, &#x201c;I wasn&#x2019;t influenced by that.&#x201d; They might acknowledge that others could be &#x201c;fooled,&#x201d; but <i>they</i> don&#x2019;t think they were. That is what gives mindless eating so much power over us&#x2013;we&#x2019;re not aware it&#x2019;s happening.<br><br>Even when we <i>do</i> pay close attention we are suggestible&#x2013;and even when it comes to cold, hard numbers. If you ask people if there are more or less than 50 calories in an apple, most will say more. When you ask them how many, the average person will say, &#x201c;66.&#x201d; If you had instead asked if there were more or less than 150 calories in an apple, most would say less.

In these burrows, the Viet Cong cached their weapons, tended their wounded, and prepared to strike. They had only one enemy: U.S. soldiers small and wiry enough to maneuver through the guerrillas&#x2019; narrow domain. <br><br> The brave souls who descended into these hellholes were known as &#x201c;tunnel rats.&#x201d; Armed with only pistols and K-bar knives, these men inched their way through the steamy darkness where any number of horrors could be awaiting them&#x2013;bullets, booby traps, a tossed grenade. Using firsthand accounts from men and women on both sides who fought and killed in these underground battles, authors Tom Mangold and John Penycate provide a gripping inside look at this fearsome combat. The Tunnels of Cu Chi<i> </i>is a war classic of unbearable tension and unforgettable heroes.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>The Tunnels of Cu Chi</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A claustrophobic but fascinating tale.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>The Wall Street Journal</b></i><br><br>&#x201c;Chilling . . . what war really was and how it was fought.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The New York Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Gripping . . . highly recommended.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Philadelphia Inquirer</i></b>&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;Remarkable.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;</b><i><b>The Washington Post</b></i></p><p>Tom Mangold has been an investigative reporter with BBC TV and a reporter for the Sunday Mirror and the Daily Express.

Nam Thuan lay very still, trying to count the number, but in his eyes and ears was only the fusion of squeaky steel belts and the approaching halo of dirt as the American armor moved busily out of the early morning sun and straight toward him.<br> &nbsp;<br> As Communist party secretary of Phu My Hung village with its six small hamlets, Nam Thuan was automatically political commissar of the village defense force, a small unit already much depleted by action and promotions to the regional fighting forces. His small platoon that morning comprised a good deputy commander and a couple of village farm boys. His orders had been simple enough: He was to delay any American thrust on Phu My Hung by luring the enemy into engagement. He would destroy them if possible; if not, his diversionary battle would allow ample time for the village to be evacuated and the arms and guerrillas to be hidden.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was August 1968; the war against the Americans was three years old. The great Tet offensive seemed to have taken many lives, yet South Vietnam had still not been reunited with the North. If anything, Thuan thought, the Americans seemed more confident and more powerful than ever. But at least they were predictable&#x2014;it was a necessary consolation as the small armored column rattled nearer; the Americans always came when expected, came noisily, and came in strength.<br> &nbsp;<br> He counted thirteen M-113 carriers. It was a larger force than he had expected. Thuan needed to move quickly if he was to draw the column toward him and toward the tunnels. To fight with he had just two remote-controlled mines which he would detonate, and a boxful of captured American M-26 grenades. In the confusion, he would retreat and escape down the tunnel, but not so quickly that the Americans would not see him.<br> &nbsp;<br> Things went wrong from the beginning. He detonated the first DH-10 mine prematurely and it exploded harmlessly just ahead of the lead American APC. The second mine failed to go off. The column was still too far away for Thuan to hurl the grenades. He stood up, deliberately breaking cover, and began to run awkwardly toward the tunnel entrance&#x2014;its position marked by the open trapdoor&#x2014;hugging the box of grenades. The lead APC spotted him and changed course to follow. Thuan wondered whether the Americans would now fire the turret-mounted machine gun; even if they did, it was improbable that a bumping gun would hit a small running target. Hands reached out of the open tunnel trapdoor to take the box of grenades. Thuan vaulted into the shaft and closed the door above his head. Blinded by the sudden change from sunlight to darkness, Thuan remained still for a few moments, crouching in the three-foot-deep shaft, gathering breath, waiting for images to return to his retinas. At the bottom of the shaft in which he stood and almost at a right angle to it began a sixty-foot communication tunnel. Thuan wriggled easily into its secure embrace. He realized he could no longer hear the noisy tracks of the APCs. Control of the battle had now passed from his hands to those of an American above ground. If the carriers passed overhead it would be impossible to rechallenge them before they reached Phu My Hung. He had been ordered not to allow that to happen.<br> &nbsp;<br> For a few moments Thuan considered his environment. He had just entered the shaft that connected with the communication tunnel. At the end of the communication tunnel was a second shaft going down another three feet and at the end of that was a second communication tunnel. If he crawled along that, he would eventually reach a similar shaft and tunnel system leading up and out. However, the exit point for this system was some 120 feet away from the place where the Americans had seen him. It was crucial to his plan that they never discover the second exit. It was only sparsely camouflaged, but he had his own man hidden there who could tell him with minimum delay what the Americans were doing above ground while Thuan was below.<br> &nbsp;<br> The tunnel was still cool from the evening air of the night before. Thuan crawled carefully into a small alcove dug some four feet into the first communication tunnel. As he hunched inside, he heard a muffled explosion followed by a blast, and a sudden beam of dust-filled sunlight pierced the shaft. The Americans had hit the tunnel trapdoor, blowing it clean away. It was what he had prayed for. The column was bound to stop while the tunnel system was fully explored and then destroyed by the Americans. As the dust and debris stung his eyes, Thuan squinted through the gloom and picked up his AK-47 automatic rifle, hugged it to his chest, and waited quietly in the alcove.<br> &nbsp;<br> He waited over an hour. When he heard the first American helicopter he knew there would be no attempt to explode the tunnel without exploration. As the machine clapped and whirred its noisy way to the ground, Thuan assumed that the Americans had flown in their special tunnel soldiers, trained to fight in the honeycomb of underground tunnels and caverns that spread beneath the protective clay of the district of Cu Chi.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thuan&#x2019;s observer, secreted above ground in the second hidden tunnel exit, had sent a messenger through the tunnels to Thuan in the alcove. The message was wholly predictable. The Americans had indeed brought more men by helicopter. They were small. They were tunnel soldiers.<br> &nbsp;<br> The first GI did not even approach the open tunnel entrance for another hour. Earlier, Thuan had heard some conversation above his hiding hole, but nothing for about thirty minutes. Whatever happened, only one American could come in at a time. Both the first entrance shaft and the second long communication tunnel were only just wide enough for one thin man. The tunnel soldiers were thin; they fought well, but unlike Nam Thuan and his small village platoon of Communist guerrillas, they had not spent years inside the tunnels of Cu Chi; they had not fought many battles in their dank blackness.<br> &nbsp;<br> Thuan could not conceive of failure. He had already been awarded one Victory Medal third class and one Victory Medal second class. He was about to earn another. Small even by Vietnamese standards, naturally slender, Thuan had never known peace in his land. His father had fought the French from similar tunnel complexes in Cu Chi when Thuan was still a child. Thuan had been allowed occasional tunnel sorties, playing soldiers with his friends. The enemy had been other village boys, ludicrously made up to look like the French soldiers, with charcoal mustaches and charcoaled arms, in an attempt to ape the perpetual wonder of hirsute Westerners.<br> &nbsp;<br> As he grew up, it was the Americans who took the place of the French, and their hairy arms and large frames were no joke to the handful of village children who had been selected by the Communist party to receive a full education. He soon hated the Americans. A friend from Hanoi had told him the Americans called the village fighters Viet Cong, to him an insulting and derogatory term. Now, at thirty-three and still unmarried, Thuan was waiting for the call to join the regular soldiers, but the party had deliberately kept him as a village commander of the part-time self-defense force. He had fought a brave war. He was cunning and ruthless and, above all, he was one of the few cadres who knew the geography of all the eight miles of underground tunnels that the villagers had built in the area. Sometimes he was the only man who could guide the soldiers from Hanoi along the tunnels on their secret journeys through Cu Chi; the men from the North marveled at being able to travel safely under the Americans&#x2019; noses.<br> &nbsp;<br> A small earth-fall from the exposed tunnel entrance warned Thuan that the first American tunnel soldier was descending. He had purposely ordered that the first shaft be dug just over three feet deep; it meant the American would have to descend feet first and then wriggle awkwardly into the long communication tunnel where Thuan waited, hidden in an alcove. In the past, as a GI&#x2019;s feet had touched the bottom, Thuan had stabbed the soldier in the groin with his bayonet. This time, as the green-and-black jungle boots descended, Thuan leaned out of his alcove and, using the light from the tunnel entrance, shot the soldier twice in the lower body.<br> &nbsp;<br> Above ground, the Americans were now in trouble. They could not drop grenades down the shaft because their mortally wounded comrade jammed the hole&#x2014;anyway, he might still be alive. Slumped in the narrow shaft, he prevented other soldiers from making their way down to chase Thuan. He guessed it would take the Americans at least thirty minutes to get the ropes slipped under the dying man&#x2019;s arms and then haul him out. The Americans&#x2019; concern for their dead and wounded remained a source of bewilderment and relief to the Communist soldiers. Anything that delayed the battle inevitably favored the weaker side and allowed reloading, regrouping and rethinking.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Rogue Knight (2) (Five Kingdoms)</h2><p>Magic and danger abound in the second book in a series of &#x201c;fanciful, action-packed adventure&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review) from the #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of the Fablehaven and Beyonders series.<br><br>Cole Randolph never meant to come to The Outskirts, but when his friends were kidnapped on Halloween he had to try and save them.

Mira, Jace, Twitch, and Joe had fallen asleep shortly after nightfall. Despite the darkness and the rhythmic trotting of the huge four-legged brick pulling the coach, Cole had failed to relax enough to sleep.<br> <br>They had been progressing toward Elloweer for many days now. Mira was so excited to see her sister that Cole sometimes wondered if she remembered that Honor was in peril. Twitch remained quiet and content, not speaking much unless asked direct questions. Joe spent most of his time focused on the possible dangers of the road. Jace grew more cranky and restless with each passing day. Cole couldn&#x2019;t blame him.<br> <br>The travel conditions helped explain Cole&#x2019;s current insomnia&#x2014;too many hours confined within the autocoach, getting little exercise and napping whenever he wanted. The days and nights blurred together, making it tricky to keep a regular schedule.<br> <br>As he sat in the dark while the others slept, the reality of his circumstances confronted him. Until a few weeks ago, Cole had lived a normal life as a sixth grader in Mesa, Arizona. Then one trip to a neighborhood haunted house on Halloween had landed Cole and his friends in the Outskirts, a mysterious realm made up of five kingdoms that each contained distinct forms of magic. As if getting stuck in another world wasn&#x2019;t terrible enough, all the kids who had traveled with Cole to the Outskirts had been branded as slaves the second they arrived.<br> <br>After a failed attempt to rescue his friends, Cole became separated from the others when he was sold to the Sky Raiders, a group of scavengers who salvaged valuable items from dangerous castles in the sky. He had no clue where any of his friends from Arizona had ended up, including his best friend, Dalton, and Jenna, the girl he&#x2019;d had a crush on for years. He knew they were somewhere in the five kingdoms, and he was determined to rescue them. But sometimes the task of finding them felt impossible.<br> <br>The only bright spot for Cole was the new friends he&#x2019;d made in the Outskirts&#x2014;including Jace, Twitch, and Mira, fellow Sky Raiders who had escaped with him. Joe had come to warn Mira of danger, and later had joined them. Cole felt that sticking with Mira was important. She had connections across Elloweer that made travel easier and that might help him find leads about his friends. Of course that meant facing a lot of danger in the meantime, since Mira was on the run from an incredibly powerful evil ruler who just happened to be her father, the High Shaper who had proclaimed himself High King. Having stolen Mira&#x2019;s power once, he wanted her abilities back, and after seeing firsthand what that power could do, Cole understood why.<br> <br>Since arriving in the Outskirts, Cole had flirted with death several times&#x2014;while scouting sky castles, escaping Skyport, and battling his way through a dreamlike land created by some magical kid. And there was no foreseeable end to the danger. How many near misses could he expect to survive?<br> <br>Home felt a million miles away. The actual distance was probably even worse. From all appearances, the Outskirts existed in a whole separate universe.<br> <br>But Cole was here in Sambria, one of the five kingdoms, and that wasn&#x2019;t changing anytime soon, so all he could do was focus on their next goal.<br> <br>Mira&#x2019;s mother had used her shaping talent to place a star in the sky above Honor, which meant Mira&#x2019;s sister was in trouble, but they had no other details. Not long ago, Mira&#x2019;s power had taken tangible form, and defeating it had nearly cost them their lives. Were they now heading toward a similar battle? They had no idea what threat Honor could be facing, but Mira was determined to rescue her.<br> <br>Bertram, the coachman, slouched forward on his bench, eyes on the floor, elderly features blank. As a semblance created by shaping, he didn&#x2019;t need sleep, but he wasn&#x2019;t designed to provide much company. He sometimes shared useful information about their route. According to Bertram, they would reach the border of Elloweer tomorrow morning.<br> <br>The autocoach usually provided a smooth ride, so when it jostled over two rough patches in succession, Cole began to pay attention. The clip-clop of the trotting brick sounded faster than he had ever heard it. Then the rhythm of the trot changed to one of a loping stride, and the speed of the autocoach increased even more.<br> <br>Neither animal nor machine, the autocoach had been created by shapers. It never tired, but it never went fast, either. Cole tapped Bertram. &#x201c;Why are we speeding up?&#x201d;<br> <br>The old man looked at him, lips quivering, one eye twitching. Bertram only spoke to share information about the roads ahead or to assure anyone who cared to listen that he was on holiday with his grandniece and grandnephews. Though his replies weren&#x2019;t always relevant, he had never failed to respond to a question.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guys!&#x201d; Cole yelled. &#x201c;Something&#x2019;s wrong!&#x201d;<br> <br>Joe&#x2019;s soft snoring sputtered to a halt. He squinted at Cole. &#x201c;Is the coach running?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;And Bertram won&#x2019;t talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>The old semblance wore a pained expression. One hand clenched sporadically.<br> <br>Joe hastily shook Mira and Jace. &#x201c;Wake up!&#x201d;<br> <br>Twitch sat up with a start. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d; he asked.<br> <br>The brick&#x2019;s pace increased to a pounding gallop. The autocoach rattled and creaked, then jolted over a sharp bump, jarring Cole&#x2019;s spine.<br> <br>Jace produced his golden rope, the magical item he obtained when he worked for the Sky Raiders. Mira reached for the Jumping Sword that their friend Liam had made for her before returning to the Grand Shaper of Sambria.<br> <br>Joe slapped Bertram briskly across the cheek. &#x201c;Bertram! Slow us down! Stop the coach!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Halt the coach, Bertram,&#x201d; Mira demanded.<br> <br>Face contorted, Bertram&#x2019;s lips peeled back as he ground his teeth. Drool leaked down his chin.<br> <br>&#x201c;Stop us, Bertram,&#x201d; Joe insisted. &#x201c;Stop us now!&#x201d;<br> <br>Rocking from side to side, Bertram screamed. The wretched, desperate cry filled Cole with panic. What could make the calm old semblance behave like this?<br> <br>If anything, the autocoach gained speed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Should we bail?&#x201d; Twitch asked, slipping on his Ellowine ring to reveal his semitransparent wings and grasshopper legs.<br> <br>&#x201c;What about our stuff?&#x201d; Jace asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;You kids go,&#x201d; Joe instructed. &#x201c;Use your renderings to land softly. I&#x2019;ll stay with the coach to see where&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>His instructions were cut off as the autocoach launched into the air. For a moment, gravity disappeared. Cole was floating, as were the others. They all came crashing down when the coach landed thunderously, slanted steeply forward as it plunged down a sharp incline.<br> <br>Cole ended up on his back with Twitch on top of him. The autocoach quaked as it skipped out of control down the slope. Before Cole could sit up, the coach went airborne again, tilting sharply to the right.<br> <br>Jace&#x2019;s golden rope suddenly expanded, zigzagging around the inside of the compartment in a complex pattern. The autocoach landed on its side and tumbled wildly, flinging Cole and his friends against yielding lengths of golden rope. The elaborate tangle cushioned their movements and kept them from slamming against the interior walls of the coach. Cole lost all sense of direction as he flopped between segments of rope, the coach whirling and shattering around him.<br> <br>The autocoach came to a rest upside down. For a moment, the occupants hung suspended like bugs in a spiderweb. The stillness and silence was eerie after the chaotic crash. Then the rope web slackened, and they dropped to the ceiling. Cole felt loopy and sore.<br> <br>&#x201c;Get out,&#x201d; Joe whispered urgently. &#x201c;This was an attack. It&#x2019;s not over. We need to move.&#x201d;<br> <br>The door had been torn from one mangled side of the coach. Twitch ducked through and into the darkness beyond. Jace shrank his rope to its normal length and exited as well. Mira went next, followed by Cole. Joe came last.<br> <br>The autocoach had settled at the bottom of an earthy ravine that was spanned by a bridge. Dim moonlight revealed steep, brushy banks sloping up on either side, and a stream, crawling down the middle, narrow enough to step across. The rocks, branches, and warped old logs littering the bottom of the ravine suggested that sometimes the stream rose higher than its current trickle.<br> <br>Cole took a deep breath of the night air. It definitely beat the odor of six bodies crammed in close confines day after day. Since they had started their journey to Elloweer, he had only left the coach to relieve himself and occasionally to eat at a roadside inn.<br> <br>Jace pressed a finger to his lips and pointed at the top of the ravine. A pair of caped, armored figures was descending the slope, one astride a huge jungle cat, the other riding what appeared to be a writhing mass of rags. The intimidating mounts glided down the incline with slinky grace.<br> <br>Crouching low, Cole held his breath. The last few days had been quiet, but he knew Mira&#x2019;s father had people hunting them. When Mira defeated the semblance monster Carnag and regained her shaping power, the High Shaper had lost all claim to her stolen abilities. With the power he took from her other sisters fading, the High Shaper would be in a panic.<br> <br>The sinister riders didn&#x2019;t look like legionnaires or city guardsmen. Could they be Enforcers? Cole had heard warnings about the High Shaper&#x2019;s secret police, but had no way of knowing if these riders were affiliated with them. Whoever they were, the sight of them gave Cole chills. In a land where reality could be reshaped, he had learned to accept the impossible, but that didn&#x2019;t mean he liked it trying to hunt him down.<br> <br>Without saying a word, the small group headed in different directions: Twitch slithered behind a log, Mira crouched behind a bush, and Jace melted into the shadows behind a rock pile. Joe ducked back into the damaged compartment. Cole crept around the autocoach, putting it between himself and the oncoming figures, which still let him peek around it to keep an eye on them. The duo advanced with little effort at subtlety. Cole realized they probably assumed the crash had left all occupants of the carriage incapacitated or dead. If not for Jace&#x2019;s rope, they would be right.<br> <br>Cole considered retrieving his Jumping Sword from the coach. With a fight brewing, he hated to be weaponless. But he worried about the noise spoiling their chance to surprise the oncoming riders. Both were almost to the floor of the ravine.<br> <br>Squinting, Cole tried to make sense of the squirming jumble of rags. The ragbeast glided along on tattered wisps of fabric, hovering more than walking. Though not very substantial, and lacking a clear shape, it seemed to support the rider without difficulty.<br> <br>Joe sidled up next to him and quietly handed Cole his Jumping Sword. &#x201c;Lay low if you can,&#x201d; Joe whispered in his ear. He held up a bow&#x2014;a shaped weapon Cole had retrieved from a sky castle and that produced an arrow every time the string was drawn. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m borrowing this. Top priority is getting Mira away from here.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bow in hand, Joe slunk away from the totaled autocoach. He stepped over the small stream and took cover in some tall brush.<br> <br>Staying low, Cole peeked as the riders prowled along the base of the ravine. They advanced straight toward the autocoach. Of course! They meant to search the wreckage! Why hadn&#x2019;t he picked a different hiding place?<br> <br>Keeping the inverted autocoach between himself and the riders, Cole backed away, crouching, Jumping Sword held ready. If they spotted him, he would use the sword to flee up the slope. Maybe he could draw them away from the others. Even with their strange mounts, the Jumping Sword might give him a chance to outrun them.<br> <br>One foot stepped into the stream, making a little splash. Cole froze.<br> <br>The big cat gave an angry yowl. Cole cringed, gritting his teeth. Beyond the coach, Cole could see Twitch had risen skyward, oversize dragonfly wings shimmering in the moonlight.<br> <br>Twitch had been spotted.<br> <br>Cole shuffled sideways in time to see Jace&#x2019;s golden rope whip around the rider on the jungle cat. The rope hoisted the armored figure high into the air, then slammed him down on a rocky patch of the streambed with a resounding clang.<br> <br>The ragbeast wheeled toward Jace. Mira sprang out of hiding, flying through the air, Jumping Sword extended. Her blade struck the ragbeast&#x2019;s rider in the side, knocking him to the ground without piercing his armor. Mira tumbled to the nearby creek bed, her sword falling from her grasp.<br> <br>The huge jungle cat streaked toward Mira. Pointing his sword at a spot ahead of the jungle cat, Cole shouted, &#x201c;Away!&#x201d;<br> <br>The sword pulled Cole through the air on a low trajectory, skimming along just above the ravine&#x2019;s floor. As the big cat pounced at Mira, Cole, backed by the momentum of his flight, plunged his blade into the feline&#x2019;s ribs. The Jumping Sword had slowed just before reaching the target, but even so, Cole drove it deep, then collided with the furry, meaty side of the huge cat. Cole spun through the air and landed on the ground, painfully wrenching his shoulder and scraping his legs.<br> <br>Twisting to nip at the sword in its side, the jungle cat hissed. Then an arrow hit the big cat in the neck.<br> <br>&#x201c;Flail, attack!&#x201d; Mira called, pointing at the feline.<br> <br>Accompanied by the crunch of smashed wood, the Shaper&#x2019;s Flail flew out of the wrecked autocoach. Composed of six heavy iron balls joined to a central ring by weighty chains, the flail whirred to the jungle cat, simultaneously pummeling it and wrapping it up. With two legs pinned, the huge feline ended up on its back, hissing and struggling.<br> <br>The armored rider Mira had unseated was now on his feet clutching a double-bit battle-ax. He clomped toward Cole, weapon raised high. Curling his legs, Cole prepared to lunge away from the downswing of the heavy weapon.<br> <br>Before he could move, a golden rope lashed the rider&#x2019;s ankles together, jerked him upward, and flung him against a boulder across the ravine. The gigantic jungle cat went still as arrows accumulated.<br> <br>Jace whipped the ragbeast a couple of times, but the golden rope passed through it without grabbing hold of anything. The attack seemed to spur the tattered mass of fabric into action. After whirling in place for a moment, the ragbeast swished by Cole, doing no more damage than a thrown pile of laundry.<br> <br>Cole went and retrieved his sword from the big cat, jiggling it to wrench it free. He wiped the blade against the animal&#x2019;s fur.<br> <br>At the top of the ravine, near the bridge, a horse gave a loud whinny. Cole glanced up in time to see the steed rearing. A rider slid off before both silhouettes moved out of sight.<br> <br>Wings fluttering, Twitch landed beside Mira. He crouched and helped her to her feet. The ragbeast glided swiftly upstream alongside the trickle of water.<br> <br>Joe ran over to them, holding an arrow ready against the bowstring. &#x201c;Mira, get that rider.&#x201d; His bow pointed toward the top of the ravine.<br> <br>&#x201c;Flail, attack,&#x201d; Mira ordered.

Besides, I&#x2019;m beginning to suspect he&#x2019;s up to something. What&#x2019;s worse, I think he suspects I&#x2019;m up to something. Which I usually am.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Not that anyone would take the word of an eleven- year-old girl against that of the Second Assistant Curator even if that girl just happens to be the daughter of the Head Curator of the museum and is rather cleverer than most (or so I&#x2019;ve been told; oddly, I don&#x2019;t think they meant it as a compliment). As far as I can tell, it doesn&#x2019;t make any difference to adults how clever children are. They always stick together. Unless you are sick or dying or mortally wounded, they will always side with the other adult.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That&#x2019;s certainly the case here, anyway. My father oversees the Museum of Legends and Antiquities, the second largest museum in London. As a result, I spend most of my time clattering around this old place. I don&#x2019;t mind. Really. Well, not much anyway. Though it would be nice if Father remembered I was here once in a while. . . However, I&#x2019;ve got plenty to do. The museum&#x2019;s got loads of secrets, and I&#x2019;ve discovered I&#x2019;m very good at ferreting out secrets. And curses. You&#x2019;d be surprised at how many things come into the museum loaded with curses bad ones. Ancient, dark, Egyptian-magic ones. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Take this morning, for example, when a crate arrived from Mum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the sound of the buzzer, I hurried down to Receiving. Dolge and Sweeny, the museum&#x2019;s two hired hands, were just opening the doors to the loading area. Yellow fog began oozing into the room like a runny pudding. Outside, I could make out the drayman, blowing on his fingers and stamping his feet, trying to stay warm as he waited next to his cart. His carriage lanterns were lit and looked like two fuzzy halos in the thick fog. Sweeny hopped off the dock and together they lifted a crate from the back of the cart and carried it inside. As they made their way past me, I craned forward to read the label. It was from Thebes! Which meant it had to be from Mum. Her first shipment from the Valley of the Kings! The first of many, most likely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once they&#x2019;d placed the crate on an empty worktable, the drayman tipped his cap and hurried back to his cart, anxious to be on his way. Dolge closed the door behind him with a resounding clang.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By this time, the curators had arrived, and we all gathered round to watch Father open the crate. As I inched closer, I saw that, once again, he wasn&#x2019;t wearing any gloves. My own gloved fingers twitched in dismay.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Um, Father?&#x201d;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He paused, his hands hovering over the crate. Yes, Theodosia?&#x201d;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aren&#x2019;t you afraid you&#x2019;ll get splinters?&#x201d; Everyone turned to stare at me oddly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Nonsense,&#x201d; he said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, I didn&#x2019;t give a fig about splinters. They were the least of my worries. But I didn&#x2019;t dare tell him that.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With everyone&#x2019;s attention once again focused on the crate, I shuffled closer to Father&#x2019;s side, trying to reach him before he actually touched whatever it was that Mum had sent. I made it past Dolge and Sweeny with no problem, but I had to hold my breath as I sidled past Fagenbush. He glared at me, and I glared back.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I reached Father&#x2019;s side, I dipped my hand into the pocket of my pinafore just as he plunged his hands into the crate. As unobtrusively as possible, I slipped a small amulet of protection out of my pocket and into his. Unfortunately, my action did not go unnoticed. He paused and scowled at me. What on earth are you doing?&#x201d;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I just wanted to get a good look, Father. I am the shortest one in the room, you know.&#x201d; To turn his attention from me back to the crate, I leaned forward and peered in. What do you think she&#x2019;s sent us this time?&#x201d;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Well, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m trying to find out.&#x201d; His voice was tinged with exasperation. Then luckily he forgot all about me as, with great ceremony, he reached into the crate and lifted out an absolutely fetching black statue of a cat: Bastet, the Egyptian fertility goddess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The moment I laid eyes on it, I felt as if a parade of icy-footed beetles were marching down my spine. My cat, Isis, who&#x2019;d been skulking under the workmen&#x2019;s bench, took one look at the statue, meowed loudly, then streeeeaked off for parts unknown. I shuddered. Once again Mother had sent us an artifact positively dripping with ancient, evil curses.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Are you all right, Theo?&#x201d; Nigel Bollingsworth, the First Assistant Curator, asked. You&#x2019;re not taking a chill, are you?&#x201d; &lt; He studied me iin concern. Next to him, Fagenbush stared at me as if I were something nasty that Isis had dragged in. No, Mr. Bolllingsworth. I&#x2019;m fine.&#x201d;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, except for the black magic rolling off the new cursed object.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, Moooooother never realized it was cursed. Nor did Father. Neither one of them ever seemed able to tell. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;None of the assistant curators seemed to notice anything, either. Except for that rat Fagenbush. He eyed the statue with his face aglow and his long, bony fingers twitching. The problem was, he looked like that half the time, so it was hard to know if it was his reaction to the artifact or he was just being his own horrid self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as I knew, I was the only one able to detect the black magic still clinging to the ancient objects. Therefore, it was up to me to discover the nature of this statue&#x2019;s curse and how to remove it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Quickly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Mother arrived tomorrow, she was sure to have loads of new artifacts with her. Even more crates would trickle in over the next few weeks. Who knew how many of those items would be cursed? I could be busy for months! The only good thing was that it would keep me out of Mother and Father&#x2019;s way. They tend to get annoyed when I&#x2019;m underfoot, and then begin talking of sending me off to school. This way, at least I&#x2019;d be able to spend some time with Mum.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Still, while hunches and gut instinct were all well and good for a First Level Test, I had to be logical and scientific about this. I needed to conduct a Level Two Test as soon as possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My chance came when everyone had cleared out of the receiving bay and returned to their duties. Since I didn&#x2019;t have any duties to return to, I was able to hang back unnoticed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I went over to one of the shelves that lined the receiving area and took down a small, battered Canopic jar. It had come in badly damaged, and since it wasn&#x2019;t particularly valuable, no one had taken the time to restore it. I had begun using it for collecting wax (old candle stubs, sealing wax, that kind of thing), which I used extensively in my Second Level Test. Wax is very good at absorbing heka, or evil magic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I removed some of the wax bits from the jar and carefully set them in a circle around the base of the statue. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By dinnertime, the entire circle of wax bits was a foul greeny-black color. Drat! I don&#x2019;t think the wax has ever turned dark that quickly before. Now I had to come back and conduct a Third Level Test. Unfortunately, in order to do that, I needed moonlight. Moonlight is the only way to make the inscribed curses visible to the human eye.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Of course, the only way to view something in moonlight is at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And I loathe the museum at night.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p><h2>Clockwork Angel (1) (The Infernal Devices)</h2><p>Magic is dangerous&#x2014;but love is more dangerous still.

Do new readers need to read The Mortal Instruments before they read the new series?<p></p> <b>A:</b> The Infernal Devices take place in the same universe as The Mortal Instruments, but a hundred and fifty years before the events of the Mortal series. You absolutely don't have to read The Mortal Instruments first; I've gotten very enthusiastic feedback from people who started with <i>Clockwork Angel</i>. However, if you are a fan of the Mortal Instruments, you'll see familiar family names--Lightwood, Wayland--and get to see what the ancestors of the characters you already know were up to in the Victorian age. There is at least one character who crosses over both series: the immortal warlock Magnus Bane. For those familiar with the Mortal books, it should be fun to meet him again; for those who haven't read them, it should be fun to meet him for the first time!<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Do you have a favorite character in <i>Clockwork Angel</i>? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Like Tessa, I'm torn between Jem and Will! They were both so wonderfully fun to write. Despite having a close brotherly bond, they're really opposites in personality. Will is a character who hides almost everything about himself; Jem is a character who is almost unendingly open and kind. Of course, when either kind of character reaches their breaking point, you have those moments of high drama and intensity that are catnip to writers!<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What characteristic or personality trait does Tessa possess that you most admire? <p></p> <b>A:</b> She is extremely persistent and unwilling to give up. When she's imprisoned, she doesn't stop trying to escape; she never stops trying learn new information; she never stops looking for her brother. She never fades quietly into the background; she plants her feet and asks questions--and gets answers, often from the unlikeliest of sources.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> How much research did you do for <i>Clockwork Angel</i>? What was the most interesting thing that you learned?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Starting in January of 2009 I took a six-month period of reading only books written during, or set in, the Victorian era--both fiction and nonfiction. I have an entire bookshelf now dedicated just to Victoriana. I also hired a research assistant who dug through primary source materials to find me letters and diaries written at the time. I was especially keen to find diaries of Americans traveling abroad, since Tessa is an American in London. I wanted to get a sense of what her impression as a foreigner would have been. One of the creepiest things I learned about was Victorian death photos, where they would prop up corpses to seem alive and take photos of them for their loved ones to have as keepsakes.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> Which type of character is the most fun for you to write--the hero or the villain? <p></p> <b>A:</b> There's a huge appeal to writing both, but there's something special about creating a really good villain. The villain stands outside society. He or she can say or do anything without fear of what the consequences will be for his/her relationships with the other characters. Sometimes the villain is the only one who can speak a vicious or painful truth and get away with it. <p></p> <br>Cassandra Clare is the #1&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>USA TODAY</i>&nbsp;bestselling author of&nbsp;<i>The Red Scrolls of Magic</i>,<i>&nbsp;</i>as well as the internationally bestselling Dark Artifices trilogy, Mortal Instruments series, and Infernal Devices trilogy.

A. Brill, who for almost forty years was the standard-bearer of Freudian theories in America.</b><br><br>� <i>Psychopathology of Everyday Life</i>&nbsp;is perhaps the most accessible of Freud&#x2019;s books.

Between the ages of four and eighty-two his home was in Vienna; in 1938 Hitler's invasion of Austria forced him to seek asylum in London, where he died in the following year.His career began with several years of brilliant work on the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system. He was almost thirty when, after a period of study under Charcot in Paris, his interests first turned to psychology, and another ten years of clinical work in Vienna (at first in collaboration with Breuer, an older colleague) saw the birth of his creation, psychoanalysis. This began simply as a method of treating neurotic patients by investigating their minds, but it quickly grew into an accumulation of knowledge about the workings of the mind in general, whether sick or healthy. Freud was thus able to demonstrate the normal development of the sexual instinct in childhood and, largely on the basis of an examination of dreams, arrived at his fundamental discovery of the unconscious forces that influence our everyday thoughts and actions. Freud's life was uneventful, but his ideas have shaped not only many specialist disciplines, but the whole intellectual climate of the last half century.<br><br><b>A. A. Brill </b>(1874&#x2013;1948) was the standard-bearer of Freudian theories in America for almost forty years.1<br> FORGETTING OF PROPER NAMES<br> &nbsp;<br> During the year 1898, I published a short essay, On the Psychic Mechanism of Forgetfullness.1 I shall now repeat its contents and take it as a starting-point for further discussion. I have there undertaken a psychologic analysis of a common case of temporary forgetfulness of proper names, and from a pregnant example of my own observation, I have reached the conclusion that this frequent and practically unimportant occurrence of a failure of a psychic function&#x2014;of memory&#x2014;admits an explanation which goes beyond the customary utilization of this phenomenon.<br> &nbsp;<br> If an average psychologist should be asked to explain how it happens that we often fail to recall a name which we are sure we know, he would probably content himself with the answer that proper names are more apt to be forgotten than any other content of memory. He might give plausible reasons for this &#x201c;forgetting preference&#x201d; for proper names, but he would not assume any deep determinant for the process.<br> &nbsp;<br> I was led to examine exhaustively the phenomenon of temporary forgetfulness through the observation of certain peculiarities, which, although not general, can, nevertheless, be seen clearly in some cases. In these, there is not only forgetfulness, but also false recollection; he who strives for the escaped name brings to consciousness others&#x2014;substitutive names&#x2014;which, although immediately recognized as false, nevertheless obtrude themselves with great tenacity. The process which should lead to the reproduction of the lost name is, as it were, displaced, and thus brings one to an incorrect substitute.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now it is my assumption that the displacement is not left to psychic arbitrariness, but that it follows lawful and rational paths. In other words, I assume that the substitutive name (or names) stands in direct relation to the lost name, and I hope, if I succeed in demonstrating this connection, to throw light on the origin of the forgetting of names.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the example which I selected for analysis in 1898, I vainly strove to recall the name of the master who made the imposing frescoes of the &#x201c;Last Judgment&#x201d; in the dome of Orvieto. Instead of the lost name&#x2014;Signorelli&#x2014;two other names of artists&#x2014;Botticelli and Boltraffio&#x2014;obtruded themselves, names which my judgment immediately and definitely rejected as being incorrect. When the correct name was imparted to me by an outsider, I recognized it at once without any hesitation. The examination of the influence and association paths which caused the displacement from Signorelli to Botticelli and Boltraffio led to the following results:<br> &nbsp;<br> (a) The reason for the escape of the name Signorelli is neither to be sought in the strangeness in itself of this name nor in the psychologic character of the connection in which it was inserted. The forgotten name was just as familiar to me as one of the substitutive names&#x2014;Botticelli&#x2014;and somewhat more familiar than the other substitute&#x2014;Boltraffio&#x2014;of the possessor of which I could hardly say more than that he belonged to the Milanese School. The connection, too, in which the forgetting of the name took place appeared to me harmless, and led to no further explanation. I journeyed by carriage with a stranger from Ragusa, Dalmatia, to a station in Herzegovina. Our conversation drifted to travelling in Italy, and I asked my companion whether he had been in Orvieto and had seen there the famous frescoes of&#x2014;&#x2014;.<br> &nbsp;<br> (b) The forgetting of the name could not be explained until after I had recalled the theme discussed immediately before this conversation. This forgetting then made itself known as a disturbance of the newly emerging theme caused by the theme preceding it. In brief, before I asked my travelling companion if he had been in Orvieto, we had been discussing the customs of the Turks living in Bosnia and Herzegovina. I had related what I heard from a colleague who was practising medicine among them, namely, that they show full confidence in the physician and complete submission to fate. When one is compelled to inform them that there is no help for the patient, they answer: &#x201c;Sir (Herr), what can I say? I know that if he could be saved, you would save him.&#x201d; In these sentences alone we can find the words and names: Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Herr (Sir), which may be inserted in an association series between Signorelli, Botticelli and Boltraffio.<br> &nbsp;<br> (c) I assume that the stream of thoughts concerning the customs of the Turks in Bosnia, etc., was able to disturb the next thought, because I withdrew my attention from it before it came to an end. For I recalled that I wished to relate a second anecdote which was next to the first in my memory. These Turks value sexual pleasure above all else, and at sexual disturbances merge into an utter despair which strangely contrasts with their resignation at the peril of losing their lives. One of my colleague&#x2019;s patients once told him: &#x201c;For you know, Sir (Herr), if that ceases, life no longer has any charm.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I refrained from imparting this characteristic feature because I did not wish to touch upon such a delicate theme in conversation with a stranger. But I went still further; I also deflected my attention from the continuation of the thought which might have associated itself in me with the theme &#x201c;Death and Sexuality.&#x201d; I was at that time under the after-effects of a message which I had received a few weeks before, during a brief sojourn in Trafoi. A patient on whom I had spent much effort had ended his life on account of an incurable sexual disturbance. I know positively that this sad event, and everything connected with it, did not come to my conscious recollection on that trip in Herzegovina. However, the agreement between Trafoi and Boltraffio forces me to assume that this reminiscence was at that time brought into activity despite all the intentional deviation of my attention.<br> &nbsp;<br> (d) I can no longer conceive the forgetting of the name Signorelli as an accidental occurrence. I must recognize in this process the influence of a motive. There were motives which actuated the interruption in the communication of my thoughts (concerning the customs of the Turks, etc.), which later influenced me to exclude from my consciousness the thoughts connected with them, and which might have led to the message concerning the incident in Trafoi&#x2014;that is, I wanted to forget something, I repressed something. To be sure, I wished to forget something other than the name of the master of Orvieto; but this other thought brought about an associative connection between itself and this name, so that my act of volition missed the aim, and I forgot the one against my will, while I intentionally wished to forget the other. The disinclination to recall directed itself against the one content; the inability to remember appeared in another. The case would have been obviously simpler if this disinclination and the inability to remember had concerned the same content. The substitutive names no longer seem so thoroughly unjustified as they seemed before this explanation. They remind me (after the form of a compromise) as much of what I wished to forget as of what I wished to remember, and show me that my object to forget something was neither a perfect success nor a failure.<br> &nbsp;<br> (e) The nature of the association formed between the lost name and the repressed theme (death and sexuality, etc.), containing the names of Bosnia, Herzegovina and Trafoi, is also very strange. In the scheme inserted here, which originally appeared in 1898, an attempt is made to graphically represent these associations.<br> &nbsp;<br> The name Signorelli was thus divided into two parts. One pair of syllables (elli) returned unchanged in one of the substitutions, while the other had gained, through the translation of signor (Sir, Herr), many and diverse relations to the name contained in the repressed theme, but was lost through it in the reproduction. Its substitution was formed in a way to suggest that a displacement took place along the same associations&#x2014;&#x201c;Herzegovina and Bosnia&#x201d;&#x2014;regardless of the sense and acoustic demarcation. The names were therefore treated in this process like the written pictures of a sentence which is to be transformed into a picture-puzzle (rebus). No information was given to consciousness concerning the whole process, which, instead of the name Signorelli, was thus changed to the substitutive names. At first sight, no relation is apparent between the theme that contained the name Signorelli and the repressed one which immediately preceded it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps it is not superfluous to remark that the given explanation does not contradict the conditions of memory reproduction and forgetting assumed by other psychologists, which they seek in certain relations and dispositions. Only in certain cases have we added another motive to the factors long recognized as causative in forgetting names, and have thus laid bare the mechanism of faulty memory. The assumed dispositions are indispensable also in our case, in order to make it possible for the repressed element to associatively gain control over the desired name and take it along into the repression. Perhaps this would not have occurred in another name having more favorable conditions of reproduction. For it is quite probable that a suppressed element continually strives to assert itself in some other way, but attains this success only where it meets with suitable conditions. At other times, the suppression succeeds without disturbance of function, or, as we may justly say, without symptoms.<br> &nbsp;<br> When we recapitulate the conditions for forgetting a name with faulty recollection we find: (1) a certain disposition to forget the name; (2) a process of suppression which has taken place shortly before; and (3) the possibility of establishing an outer association between the concerned name and the element previously suppressed. The last condition will probably not have to be much overrated, for the slightest claim on the association is apt in most cases to bring it about. But it is a different and farther-reaching question whether such outer association can really furnish the proper condition to enable the suppressed element to disturb the reproduction of the desired name, or whether after all a more intimate connection between the two themes is not necessarily required. On superficial consideration, one may be willing to reject the latter requirement and consider the temporal meeting in perfectly dissimilar contents as sufficient. But on more thorough examination, one finds more and more frequently that the two elements (the repressed and the new one) connected by an outer association, possess besides a connection in content, and this can also be demonstrated in the example, Signorelli.<br> &nbsp;<br> The value of the understanding gained through the analysis of the example Signorelli naturally depends on whether we must explain this case as a typical or as an isolated process. I must now maintain that the forgetting of a name associated with faulty recollection not uncommonly follows the same process as was demonstrated in the case of Signorelli. Almost every time that I observed this phenomenon in myself, I was able to explain it in the manner indicated above as being motivated by repression.<br> &nbsp;<br> I must mention still another viewpoint in favor of the typical nature of our analysis. I believe that one is not justified in separating the cases of name-forgetting with faulty recollection from those in which incorrect substitutive names have not obtruded themselves. These substitutive names occur spontaneously in a number of cases; in other cases, where they do not come spontaneously, they can be brought to the surface by concentration of attention, and they then show the same relation to the repressed element and the lost name as those that come spontaneously. Two factors seem to play a part in bringing to consciousness the substitutive names: first, the effort of attention, and second, an inner determinant which adheres to the psychic material. I could find the latter in the greater or lesser facility which forms the required outer associations between the two elements. A great many of the cases of name-forgetting without faulty recollection therefore belong to the cases with substitutive name formation, the mechanism of which corresponds to the one in the example Signorelli. But I surely shall not venture to assert that all cases of name-forgetting belong to the same group. There is no doubt that there are cases of name-forgetting that proceed in a much simpler way. We shall represent this state of affairs carefully enough if we assert that besides the simple forgetting of proper names, there is another forgetting which is motivated by repression.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Stones from the River</h2><p>From the acclaimed author of <i>Floating in My Mother&#x2019;s Palm</i> and <i>Children and Fire</i>, a stunning story about ordinary people living in extraordinary times&#x2014;&#x201c;epic, daring, magnificent, the product of a defining and mesmerizing vision&#x201d; (<i>Los Angeles Times</i>).<br><br>Trudi Montag is a <i>Zwerg</i>&#x2014;a dwarf&#x2014;short, undesirable, different, the voice of anyone who has ever tried to fit in.

To its credit, <i>Stones</i> does not wilt from the comparison. Hegi's book has a distinctive, appealing flavor of its own. Stone's characters are off-center enough to hold your attention despite the inevitable dominance of the setting: There's Trudi's mother, who slowly goes insane living in an "earth nest" beneath the family house; Trudi's best friend Georg, whose parents dress him as the girl they always wanted; and, of course, Trudi herself, whose condition dooms her to long for an impossible normalcy. Futhermore, the reader's inevitable sympathy for Trudi, the dwarf, heightens the true grotesqueness of Nazi Germany. <i>Stones from the River</i> is a nightmare journey with an unforgettable guide.<i>Stones from the River</i> is a daring, dramatic and complex novel of life in Germany. It is set in Burgdorf, a small fictional German town, between 1915 and 1951. The protagonist is Trudi Montag, a Zwerg -- the German word for dwarf woman. As a dwarf she is set apart, the outsider whose physical "otherness" has a corollary in her refusal to be a part of Burgdorf's silent complicity during and after World War II. Trudi establishes her status and power, not through beauty, marriage, or motherhood, but rather as the town's librarian and relentless collector of stories. <p>Through Trudi's unblinking eyes, we witness the growing impact of Nazism on the ordinary townsfolk of Burgdorf as they are thrust on to a larger moral stage and forced to make choices that will forever mark their lives. <i>Stones from the River</i> is a story of secrets, parceled out masterfully by Trudi -- and by Ursula Hegi -- as they reveal the truth about living through unspeakable times.</p></p><h2>National Wildlife Federation Field Guide to Birds of North America</h2><p>From the National Wildlife Federation� comes the most up-to-date, all-photographic field guide to North American birds.

Spain, eager to capitalise on the great resources and wealth present, sent successive fleets of vessels to the Caribbean to set up colonial outposts as footholds in the new continent. <br><br> Despite being small in number, the Spanish colonists had superior arms and were able to forcibly subdue the native populations. Murder, rape and other atrocities were commonplace in the process, with many natives afterwards becoming enslaved. While wealth was amassed, the moral depravity involved would appal the socially conscious at home. <br><br> Bartolom� de las Casas, a friar who intensely opposed such inhumane behavior, was moved to author his account of the colonial era, which he defined by a succession of harms inflicted on native peoples. For his part, Las Casas would assume place as a dogged defender of West Indian peoples, putting pressure on the Spanish court to enact laws protecting native welfare.</p><p>Bartolome de las Casas was born in Seville around 1484. At the age of eighteen he left for the New World, where he participated in the conquest of Cuba and witnessed the first full-scale massacre of an Indian community. He became a priest and entered the Dominican order. He dedicated himself to the protection and defence of the Indians.

The sticker was missing my second last name. Maybe Miss Soria's pen ran out of ink. I took my pencil and added it. Now it looked right: Rene Colato Lainez.''<br><br> Young Rene is from El Salvador, and he doesn't understand why his name has to be different in the United States. When he writes Colato, he sees his paternal grandparents, Rene and Amelia. When he writes Lainez, he sees his maternal grandparents, Angela and Julio. Without his second "like a hamburger without the meat or a pizza without cheese or a hot dog without a wiener."<br><br> His new classmates giggle when Rene tells them his name. "That's a long dinosaur name," one says. "Your name is longer than an anaconda," another laughs. But Rene doesn't want to lose the part of him that comes from his mother's family. So when the students are given a project to create a family tree, Rene is determined to explain the importance of using both of his last names. On the day of his presentation, Rene explains that he is as hard working as Abuelo Rene, who is a farmer, and as creative as his Abuela Amelia, who is a potter. He can tell stories like his Abuelo Julio and enjoys music like his Abuela Angela. <br> This charming bilingual picture book for children ages 4 - 8 combines the winning team of author Rene Colato Lainez and illustrator Fabiola Graullera Ramirez, and follows their award-winning collaboration, I Am Rene, the Boy / Soy Rene, el nino. With whimsical illustrations and entertaining text, this sequel is sure to please fans and gain many new ones while explaining an important Hispanic cultural tradition.</p><p>RENE COLATO LAINEZ came to the United States from El Salvador as a teen, and he writes about his experiences in children's books such as <i>Waiting for Papa / Esperando a Papa</i> (Pinata Books, 2004) and <i>I Am Rene, the Boy / Soy Rene, el nino</i> (Pinata Books, 2005), which received Special Recognition in the 2006 Paterson Prize for Books for Young People.

Her work has been part of collective exhibits in Mexico and Spain. She has illustrated many picture books, including <i>I Am Rene, the Boy / Soy Rene, el nino</i> (Pinata Books, 2005)."On the first day in his new school, Rene's teacher gives everyone a nametag with their first and last names. Though Rene's last name, like many Salvadorans', has two parts, Colato Lainez, his tag reads only Rene Colato. Maybe the teacher ran out of ink? Adding Lainez on his own, Rene is teased about having an unusually long dinosaur name but uses the opportunity of a family-tree assignment to instruct everyone, including the teacher, about why both names together represent his full Italian and Spanish heritage. Rene's full name proudly reminds him that he is a product of both his father and mother's family histories, both rich in talent and hard work. Drawing from his personal immigrant experience, the author tells his story in a bilingual narration, his sincere, earnest voice augmented by Graullera Ramirez's softly colored cartoon-style watercolor scenes of family and classmates. The significance of this Hispanic tradition respecting both sides of a child's parentage is well explained in this easily understood example of cultural differences." --Kirkus Reviews<br><br>"A moving story about one of the many issues faced by children from Latin America but told in a most charming way.

"Would you consider a promotion?" Other invitations we never want to receive but must respond to all the same: "What treatment do you want for your tumor?" Invitations pound away at the coastlines of the soul with a transforming force. God is also sending invitations. Sometimes they seem less compelling than anything on my to-do list. Why would I want to say yes to the invitation to rest when I'm already so far behind? Why follow when I could lead? Why accept invitations to weep or to admit I am wrong or to wait?

Healy champion a brilliant summation of the Thomistic doctrines that offers the reader an encounter with wisdom and the use of that wisdom in understanding and knowing our Lord and Redeemer Jesus Christ.<br><br> My Way of Life presents small, concise portions of the Summa in a manageable format. This work will allow the reader to consider some of the highest thoughts of one of history&#x2019;s greatest minds and apply them to the modern world, including:<br><br> � The Oneness of God<br> � The nature of Angels (p. 63)<br> � The hierarchy of angels, demons, and humans (p. 121)<br> � Man&#x2019;s disposition to pursue happiness<br> � The Divine Life in man<br> � The Incarnation Jesus and its ramifications (p. 443)<br> � The Last Things (Death, Judgment, Heaven, and Hell)<br><br> With My Way of Life the timelessness of the Summa is now accessible to all. In a world that seems to simultaneously advance in some areas and regress in others, the Summa Theologica powerfully reminds the reader that by definition, the true, and the good, and the beautiful never change.<br><br> A portion of the proceeds from every purchase of this Confraternity of the Precious Blood title go directly to The Sisters Adorers of the Precious Blood in Brooklyn, NY to support them in their vocation.<br></p><p>Father Walter Farrell, O.P., was one of the most noted Thomist of his day and founded The Thomist in 1939. Father Farrell passed away soon after the completion of Part I. Father Martin Healy wrote Parts II and III while he was Professor of Dogmatic Theology at the Seminary of the Immaculate Conception in New York.&nbsp;<br></p><h2>The Map and the Territory (Vintage International)</h2><p><p>The most celebrated and controversial French novelist of our time delivers a riveting masterpiece about art and money, love and friendship, and fathers and sons.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jed Martin is an artist. His first photographs feature Michelin road maps, and global success arrives with his series on professions: portraits of various personalities, including a writer named Houellebecq. Not long afterward, Jed helps a police inspector solve a heinous crime that leaves lasting marks on everyone involved. But after burying his father and growing old himself, Jed also discovers serenity, a deeply moving conclusion to a life of lovers, friends, and family, and filled with hopes, losses, and dreams.</p></p><p>Already honored with the Prix Novembre and the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, <b>Michel Houellebecq</b> won the Prix Goncourt for <i>The Map and the Territory</i> in 2010.Jeff Koons had just got up from his chair, enthusiastically throwing his arms out in front of him. Sitting opposite him, slightly hunched up, on a white leather sofa partly draped with silks, Damien Hirst seemed to be about to express an objection; his face was flushed, morose. Both of them were wearing black suits&#x2014;Koons&#x2019;s had fine pinstripes&#x2014;and white shirts and black ties. Between them, on the coffee table, was a basket of candied fruits that neither paid any attention to. Hirst was drinking a Bud Light.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind them, a bay window opened onto a landscape of tall buildings that formed a Babylonian tangle of gigantic polygons that stretched across the horizon. The night was bright, the air absolutely clear. They could have been in Qatar, or Dubai; the decoration of the room was, in reality, inspired by an advertisement photograph, taken from a German luxury publication, of the Emirates Palace Hotel in Abu Dhabi.<br> &nbsp;<br> Koons&#x2019;s forehead was slightly shiny. Jed shaded it with his brush and stepped back three paces. There was certainly a problem with Koons. Hirst was basically easy to capture: you could make him brutal, cynical in an &#x201c;I shit on you from the top of my pile of cash&#x201d; kind of way; you could also make him a <i>rebel</i> <i>artist</i> (but rich all the same) pursuing an <i>anguished</i> <i>work</i> <i>on</i> <i>death</i>; finally, there was in his face something ruddy and heavy, typically English, which made him look like a rank-and-file Arsenal supporter. In short, there were various aspects to him, but all of them could be combined into a coherent, representative portrait of a British artist typical of his generation. Koons, on the other hand, seemed to have a duality, an insurmountable contradiction between the basic cunning of the technical sales rep and the exaltation of the ascetic. It was already three weeks now that Jed had been retouching Koons&#x2019;s expression as he stood up from his chair, throwing out his arms as if he were trying to convince Hirst of something. It was as difficult as painting a Mormon pornographer.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had photographs of Koons on his own, in the company of Roman Abramovich, Madonna, Barack Obama, Bono, Warren Buffett, Bill Gates... Not one of them managed to express anything of the personality of Koons, to go beyond the appearance of a Chevrolet convertible salesman that he had decided to display to the world, and this was exasperating. In fact, for a long time photographers had exasperated Jed, especially the <i>great</i> <i>photographers,</i> with their claim to reveal in their snapshots the <i>truth</i> of their models. They didn&#x2019;t reveal anything at all, just placed themselves in front of you and switched on the motor of their camera to take hundreds of random snapshots while chuckling, and later chose the least bad of the lot; that&#x2019;s how they proceeded, without exception, all those so-called <i>great</i> <i>photographers.</i> Jed knew some of them personally and had nothing but contempt for them; he considered them all about as creative as a Photomaton.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the kitchen, a few steps behind him, the boiler uttered a succession of loud banging noises. It went rigid, paralyzed. It was already 15 December.<br> &nbsp;<br> One year before, on almost the same date, his boiler had uttered the same succession of banging noises before stopping completely. In a few hours, the temperature in the studio had fallen to thirty-seven degrees. He had managed to sleep a little, or rather doze off, for brief periods. Around six in the morning, he had emptied the hot-water tank to wash himself quickly, then had brewed coffee while waiting for the man from Plumbing in General, who had promised to send someone in the early hours of the morning.<br> &nbsp;<br> On its Web site, Plumbing in General offered to &#x201c;make plumbing enter the third millennium&#x201d;; they could at least start by turning up on time, grumbled Jed at about eleven, pacing around his studio in a vain attempt to warm himself up. He was then working on a painting of his father, which he was going to entitle <i>The</i> <i>Architect</i> <i>Jean-Pierre Martin Leaving the Management of His Business;</i> inevitably, the drop in temperature meant that the last layer of paint would take an age to dry. He had agreed, as he did every year, to dine with his father on Christmas Eve, two weeks hence, and hoped to have finished it by then; if a plumber didn&#x2019;t intervene quickly, his plan risked being compromised. To tell the truth, in absolute terms, it wasn&#x2019;t that important: he didn&#x2019;t intend to offer this painting to his father as a gift; he wanted simply to <i>show</i> it to him. Why, then, was he suddenly attaching so much importance to it? He was at the end of his tether; he was working too hard, had started six paintings simultaneously. For a few months he hadn&#x2019;t stopped. It wasn&#x2019;t sensible.<br> &nbsp;<br> At around three in the afternoon, he decided to call Plumbing in General again, but the line was constantly engaged. He managed to get through to them just after five, when the customer-service secretary explained that there had been an exceptional workload due to the frigid weather, but promised that someone would certainly come the following morning. Jed hung up, then reserved a room in the Mercure Hotel on the boulevard Auguste-Blanqui.<br> &nbsp;<br> He waited all of the following day for the arrival of Plumbing in General, but also for Simply Plumbers, whom he had managed to contact in the meantime. While Simply Plumbers promised to respect the craft traditions of &#x201c;higher plumbing,&#x201d; they showed themselves to be no more capable of turning up on time.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the painting he had made of him, Jed&#x2019;s father, standing on a podium in the middle of the group of about fifty employees that made up his business, was lifting his glass with a sorrowful smile. The farewell party took place in the open space of his architectural practice, a large room thirty meters by twenty with white walls and a skylight, under which computer design posts alternated with trestle tables carrying the scale models of current projects. Most of those present were nerdy-looking young people&#x2014;the 3-D designers. Standing at the foot of the podium, three fortysomething architects surrounded his father. In accordance with a configuration borrowed from a minor painting by Lorenzo Lotto, each of them avoided the eyes of the others, while trying to catch those of his father; each of them, you understood right away, nurtured the hope of succeeding him as the head of the business. His father&#x2019;s eyes, staring just above those present, expressed the desire to gather his team around him for one last time, and a reasonable confidence in the future, but also an absolute sadness. Sadness at leaving the business he had founded, to which he had given all his strength, and sadness at the inevitable: you were quite obviously dealing with a finished man.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the middle of the afternoon, Jed tried in vain, a dozen times, to get through to Ze Plumb, who used Skyrock Radio as its hold music, while Simply Plumbing had opted for the radio station Laughter and Songs.<br> &nbsp;<br> At about five, he returned to the Mercure Hotel. Night was falling on the boulevard Auguste-Blanqui; some homeless people had lit a fire on one side of the street.<br> &nbsp;<br> The subsequent days passed more or less in the same way: dialing numbers of plumbing businesses, being redirected almost instantaneously to on-hold music, waiting, as it got colder and colder, next to his painting, which refused to dry.<br> &nbsp;<br> A solution came on the morning of 24 December, in the form of a Croatian workman who lived nearby on the avenue Stephen-Pichon; Jed had noticed his sign by accident while returning from the Mercure Hotel. He was available, yes, immediately. He was a small man with black hair and a pale complexion, harmonious and fine features, and a rather Belle �poque mustache; in fact, he looked a bit like Jed&#x2014;apart from the mustache.<br> &nbsp;<br> Immediately after entering the flat, he examined the boiler for a long time, dismantling the control panel, running his slender fingers along the complex trail of pipes. He spoke of valves and siphons. He gave the impression of knowing a lot about life in general.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a quarter of an hour, his diagnosis was the following: he could repair, yes, he could do <i>a</i> <i>sort</i> <i>of</i> <i>repair</i> that would come to fifty euros, no more. But it would be less than a genuine repair job, only a makeshift one, really, that would do the trick for a few months, even a few years in the best-case scenario, but he refused to give any long-term guarantee; more generally, it was unseemly to make a long-term bet on this boiler.<br> &nbsp;<br> Jed sighed and confessed he had half expected it. He remembered very well the day when he had decided to buy this flat; he could still see the estate agent, stocky and self-satisfied, boasting of the exceptional light, but not hiding the need for certain &#x201c;improvements.&#x201d; He had then told himself that he should have become an estate agent, or a gynecologist.<br> &nbsp;<br> Barely amiable in the first few minutes, the stocky estate agent went into a lyrical trance when he learned that Jed was an artist. It was the first time, he exclaimed, that he&#x2019;d had the opportunity to sell an <i>artist&#x2019;s studio</i> to an <i>artist</i>! Jed feared for a moment that he would declare his solidarity with authentic artists against the bourgeois bohemians and other such philistines who inflated prices, thus making artist&#x2019;s studios inaccessible to artists, but what can you do? I can&#x2019;t go against the truth of the market: it&#x2019;s not my role. But fortunately this did not happen. The stocky estate agent just offered him a ten percent discount&#x2014;which he had probably already foreseen offering after a mini-negotiation.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Artist&#x2019;s studio&#x201d; really meant an attic with a skylight&#x2014;a very nice one, it must be said&#x2014;and a few dark adjoining spaces, scarcely insufficient for someone like Jed, who had very limited hygienic needs. But the view was, indeed, splendid: beyond the place des Alpes it extended as far as the boulevard Vincent-Auriol and the aboveground M�tro, and farther on to those quadrangular buildings built in the mid-seventies that were in complete opposition to the rest of the Parisian aesthetic landscape, and which were what Jed preferred in Paris, by far, in terms of architecture.<br> &nbsp;<br> The Croat did the repair job and pocketed the fifty euros. He didn&#x2019;t offer an invoice, and Jed hadn&#x2019;t expected one. The door had just closed behind him when he knocked again very gently. Jed opened the door slightly.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;By the way, monsieur,&#x201d; said the man. &#x201c;Merry Christmas. I wanted to say to you: Merry Christmas.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes, I&#x2019;d forgotten,&#x201d; said Jed, embarrassed. &#x201c;Merry Christmas to you too.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was then that he became aware of the problem of the taxi. As expected, ToAnywhere refused point-blank to drive him to Le Raincy, and Speedtax agreed to take him to the railway station, or, at a pinch, as far as the town hall, but certainly not near the Cicadas housing complex. &#x201c;Security reasons, monsieur,&#x201d; whispered the employee with a slight reproach in his voice. &#x201c;We only serve completely safe zones, monsieur,&#x201d; said the receptionist for Fernand Garcin Cars with smooth self-importance. Jed felt more and more guilty about wanting to spend Christmas Eve in such an incongruous place and, as happened every year, began to get angry with his father, who obstinately refused to quit that bourgeois house, surrounded by a vast park, that population movements had gradually relegated to the heart of a zone that got ever more dangerous, and which had recently fallen under the complete control of gangs.<br> &nbsp;<br> First, the perimeter wall had needed to be reinforced and topped with an electrified fence, then a CCTV system linked to the police station was installed, all so his father could wander alone in twelve rooms that were impossible to heat and where no one came except Jed, every Christmas Eve. The nearby shops had long since closed, and it was impossible to walk around the neighboring streets, since even attacks on cars stopped at traffic lights were not unheard of. The Raincy Council had given him a home-care aide&#x2014;a cantankerous and nasty Senegalese woman called Fatty who had disliked him from the start, refused to change the sheets more than once a month, and most probably stole from the shopping allowance.<br> &nbsp;<br> Be that as it may, the temperature was rising slowly in the room. Jed took a photo of the painting in progress, which would at least give him something to show his father. He took off his trousers and his pullover, sat down cross-legged on the narrow mattress on the floor that served as his bed, and wrapped himself in a blanket. Gradually, he slowed the rhythm of his breathing. He visualized waves rolling slowly, lazily, beneath a matte twilight. He tried to lead his mind to a place of calm, and prepare himself as best he could for another Christmas Eve with his father.<br> &nbsp;<br> This mental preparation bore fruit, and the following evening was a zone of neutral time, even semi-convivial; he had hoped for nothing more.<br> &nbsp;<br> The next morning, at about seven, assuming that the gangs too had <i>celebrated</i> <i>Christmas,</i> Jed walked to Raincy Station and got back to the Gare de l&#x2019;Est without a hitch.<br> &nbsp;<br> One year on, the boiler repair had held, and this was the first time that it had shown signs of weakness. <i>The</i> <i>Architect</i> <i>Jean-Pierre Martin Leaving the Management of His Business</i> had been finished for some time and put into storage by Jed&#x2019;s gallerist in anticipation of a solo exhibition that was taking a while to organize. Jean-Pierre Martin himself&#x2014;to the surprise of his son, who had long since given up talking to him about it&#x2014;had decided to leave the house in Le Raincy and move into a nursing home in Boulogne. Their annual meal would this time take place in a brasserie on the avenue Bosquet called Chez Papa. Jed had chosen it on the strength of an ad in <i>Pariscope</i> promising traditional quality, <i>� l&#x2019;ancienne,</i> and this promise was, on the whole, kept. Some Father Christmases and trees decorated with tinsel sprinkled the half-empty room, essentially occupied by small groups of old people, some very old, who chewed carefully, consciously, and even ferociously on dishes of traditional cuisine. There were wild boar, suckling pig, and turkey; for dessert, of course, a patisserie Yule log <i>� l&#x2019;ancienne</i> was proposed by the house, whose polite and discreet waiters operated in silence, as if in a burn unit. Jed had been a bit stupid, he realized, to offer his father such a meal. This dry, serious man, with a long and austere face, never seemed to have been taken by the pleasures of the table, and the rare times Jed had dined out with him, when he had needed to see him near his place of work, his father had chosen a sushi restaurant&#x2014;always the same one. It was pathetic and vain to want to establish a gastronomical conviviality that had no raison d&#x2019;�tre, and which had not even conceivably ever had one&#x2014;his mother, while she was alive, had always hated cooking. But it was Christmas, and what else could you do? His father didn&#x2019;t seem interested in much anymore; he read less and less, and wa...</p><h2>My Darkest Prayer</h2><p>Whether it&#39;s working at his cousin&#39;s funeral home or tossing around the local riff raff at his favorite bar, Nathan Waymaker is a man who knows how to handle the bodies.

It lives, it grows and so do its recipes. <br> &nbsp;<br> In the twenty-two years since we wrote our first cookbook or &#x201c;the blue book,&#x201d; as it has become known, much has changed&#x2014;the way we eat, the way we shop and the way we cook. There has been an explosion in the availability of ingredients. Vegetables arrive daily from the Milan market, mozzarella is flown in from Naples, people grow herbs in their window boxes and salad leaves in their gardens. <br> &nbsp;<br> Everyone is a chef.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our first book, <i>The River Cafe Cookbook, </i>was written originally to be a manual for our own chefs to follow. But, as chefs, we have grown as well. We have traveled all over Italy, from Piemonte to Sicily, discovering new ingredients, new methods and, most of all, new people to expand our knowledge of the food we love. So, in thirty years, our book has changed.<br> &nbsp;<br> To celebrate our thirtieth birthday, we returned to our first recipes in the blue book. Here we share our knowledge and experience of how we have refined those classic dishes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mixed in with the revisited classics are more than thirty new recipes created through our work and travels together: Mezze Paccheri, Black Pepper and Langoustine, an eccentric combination of langoustines with Pecorino; White Asparagus with Bottarga Butter, a variation on the classic anchovy sauce; and Crab and Raw Artichoke Salad.<br> &nbsp;<br> The design of <i>The Essential River Cafe</i>, by Anthony Michael and Stephanie Nash, is inspired by the bold art, architecture and bright colors of the restaurant&#x2014;the pink wood oven, the yellow pass, the blue carpet. The Joseph Albers font, throughout the book, reflects these qualities.<br> &nbsp;<br> Matthew Donaldson photographed the food on sunny days in our garden. Jean Pigozzi, who took the dynamic black-and-white photographs of the restaurant in action for our first book, returned to capture the customers, chefs and waiters who are the River Cafe family.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Essential River Cafe </i>is the story of a restaurant that began with two unknown chefs and a space large enough for nine tables. <br> &nbsp;<br> We have grown. We have a new vision, but the same conclusion: with good ingredients and a strong tradition, change and recipes can be timeless.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Spaghetti with Lemon</b><br> <i>Serves 6</i><br> &nbsp;<br> � pound (225g) spaghetti<br> juice of 3&#x2013;4 lemons, preferably Amalfi lemons<br> &#x2154; cup (150ml) olive oil<br> 5 ounces (140g) Parmesan, freshly grated<br> 2 handfuls of fresh basil, leaves picked and finely chopped<br> finely grated lemon zest (optional)<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Lemons, olive oil, basil . . . the only other ingredient needed is sun. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Cook the spaghetti in a generous amount of boiling salted water, then drain thoroughly and return to the pot.<br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, whisk the lemon juice with the olive oil, then stir in the Parmesan&#x2014;it will melt into the mixture, making it thick and creamy. Season with kosher salt and black pepper and add more lemon juice to taste.<br> &nbsp;<br> Add the sauce to the spaghetti and shake the pot so that each strand of pasta is coated with the cheese. Finally, stir in the chopped basil and, ideally, some grated lemon zest.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Pork Braised with Vinegar</b><br> <i>Serves 6</i><br> &nbsp;<br> one 5�-pound (2.5kg) boned shoulder of pork, rind and most of the fat removed<br> 2 tablespoons olive oil<br> &#x2154; cup (150ml) red wine vinegar<br> &#x2154; cup (150ml) Chianti Classico<br> 1 tablespoon black peppercorns<br> 12 fresh bay leaves<br> &nbsp;<br> Generously season the pork with kosher salt. In a saucepan with a lid, heat the olive oil over a medium-high heat and brown the meat on all sides. Remove the meat and put to one side. <br> &nbsp;<br> Pour the red wine vinegar into the pan. Bring to the boil and reduce the liquid by half. Add the wine, � cup (120ml) water, the peppercorns and bay leaves and lower the heat to a simmer.<br> &nbsp;<br> Return the pork to the pan and turn to coat it in the juices. Put the lid on but slightly askew. Simmer very gently for 2 hours, turning the meat two or three times during cooking. If the juices seem to be drying up, add a little more wine or water.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the meat is cooked (soft when prodded), remove the pan from the heat and let the pork relax for 5 minutes. Slice and serve with the juices and the bay leaves.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Chocolate Nemesis</b><br> <i>Serves 18</i><br> &nbsp;<br> 10 eggs<br> 2� cups (575g) granulated sugar<br> 24 ounces (675g) best-quality bittersweet chocolate (70% cocoa solids), broken into small pieces <br> 1 pound (450g) unsalted butter, softened<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Still the best chocolate cake ever. </i><br> &nbsp;<br> Preheat the oven to 250�F (130�C). Grease a 12-inch (30cm) round cake pan that is 3 inches (7.5cm) deep, then line the base with parchment paper.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whisk the eggs with a third of the sugar with an electric mixer until the volume quadruples&#x2014;this will take at least 10 minutes. <br> &nbsp;<br> Meanwhile, melt the chocolate and butter together in a heatproof bowl set over a pan of barely simmering water (the water should not touch the base of the bowl). Remove from the heat. <br> &nbsp;<br> Heat the remaining sugar with 250ml water in a small pan until the sugar has completely dissolved to a syrup, stirring occasionally. Gently pour the syrup into the melted chocolate, stirring.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reduce the speed of the mixer and slowly add the warm chocolate and syrup mixture to the eggs. Increase the speed and continue beating until completely combined. The mixture will lose volume. <br> &nbsp;<br> Pour into the prepared cake pan. Put the pan into a deep baking pan on top of a dish towel to prevent the cake pan from moving. Fill the baking pan with hot water so that it comes at least two-thirds up the sides of the cake pan. Bake for 1�&#x2013;2 hours or until set&#x2014;test by placing the flat of your hand gently on the surface of the cake.<br> &nbsp;<br> Remove the cake pan from the water. Leave the cake in the pan to completely cool before turning out (don&#x2019;t refrigerate it).

Because of its honesty about life in this fallen world, Psalm 27 speaks into the life of every believer. At the same time it places joyful and self-sacrificing worship right next to the trouble that is the psalm's background theme. This juxtaposition makes Psalm 27 unique, interesting, practical, challenging, and encouraging.</p><p><em>A Shelter in the Time of Storm</em> takes readers through this roller-coaster-ride of a psalm in fifty-two brief and engaging meditations. These meditations are designed to fill hearts with a patient hope that grows stronger as the trouble-spotted days go by. Reflection questions at the end of the chapter make these meditations thought-provoking and practical.</p></p><p><p><strong>Paul David Tripp</strong> (DMin, Westminster Theological Seminary) is a pastor, author, and international conference speaker.

There are going to be fireworks tonight, and Olivia can hardly wait to hear the band. But when she finds out that there isn't going to be a band, she can't understand why not. How can there be fireworks without a band?! And so Olivia sets to putting a band together herself...<i>all</i> by herself. Using pots, pans, her brother's toys, and even her father's suspenders, Olivia forms a band spectacular enough to startle any audience. Lavishly brought to life in Ian Falconer's signature style, and introducing an eye-catching shade of blue, here is Olivia doing what Olivia does best -- making noise.</p><p>Ian Falconer is the author and illustrator of the Olivia book series, including <i>Olivia</i>, <i>Olivia Helps with Christmas</i>, <i>Olivia and the Fairy Princesses</i>, <i>Olivia and the Missing Toy</i>, <i>Olivia Saves the Circus</i>, to name a few. Falconer&#x2019;s illustrations have graced numerous covers of <i>The New Yorker</i>. He has also designed sets and costumes for the New York City Ballet, the San Francisco Opera, the Royal Opera House, and many others. He lives in Los Angeles, California.<i>Starred Review.</i> PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;The latest escapades of a precocious piglet and the mother who attempts to both nurture and civilize her opens on the morning of a fireworks display. The charcoal-and-gouache scenes with their signature red highlights on uncluttered white backgrounds depict Olivia's family, but readers are soon treated to a series of surprises that include the introduction of a new color (turquoise), collage elements, a fold-out, and full bleeds. When the protagonist declares that a band is essential for the evening's entertainment and that, lacking one, she'll fill in, her mother's thought bubble fills with a photograph of a leaping rock band; Olivia's depicts the marching variety. The fold-out starts with the heroine as the sole majorette and reveals a full-size band of Olivias, with the score of a Sousa-like march printed boldly above. Falconer builds to a crescendo of two and a half pages that portray a picnic at sunset followed by a dazzling display of feathery fireworks. These compositions are predominantly charcoal; the family members, backs to readers, are outlined in the reflected yellow glow of an ascending rocket. The palette returns to the original color scheme in the denouement, a bedtime moment to which all ages will relate. With perfectly nuanced dialogue and a mixture of comical and artful scenes, Falconer explores the logic, invention, and humor emanating from a talented youngster, serious about the mission of the moment.<i>&#x2013;Wendy Lukehart, Washington DC Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

As Buf�fett&#x2019;s fortune and reputation grew over time, Loomis used her unique insight into Buffett&#x2019;s thinking to chronicle his work for&nbsp;<i>Fortune</i>, writ�ing and proposing scores of stories that tracked his many accomplishments&#x2014;and also his occa�sional mistakes.</p><p></p><p>Now Loomis has collected and updated the best Buffett articles&nbsp;<i>Fortune&nbsp;</i>published between 1966 and 2012, including thirteen cover stories and a dozen pieces authored by Buffett himself. Loomis has provided commentary about each major arti�cle that supplies context and her own informed point of view. Readers will gain fresh insights into Buffett&#x2019;s investment strategies and his thinking on management, philanthropy, public policy, and even parenting. Some of the highlights include:</p><ul><li>The 1966 A. W. Jones story in which&nbsp;<i>Fortune&nbsp;</i>first mentioned Buffett.</li><li>The first piece Buffett wrote for the magazine, 1977&#x2019;s &#x201c;How Inf lation Swindles the Equity Investor.&#x201d;</li><li>Andrew Tobias&#x2019;s 1983 article &#x201c;Letters from Chairman Buffett,&#x201d; the first review of his Berk�shire Hathaway shareholder letters.</li><li>Buffett&#x2019;s stunningly prescient 2003 piece about derivatives, &#x201c;Avoiding a Mega-Catastrophe.&#x201d;</li><li>His unconventional thoughts on inheritance and philanthropy, including his intention to leave his kids &#x201c;enough money so they would feel they could do anything, but not so much that they could do nothing.&#x201d;</li><li>Bill Gates&#x2019;s 1996 article describing his early impressions of Buffett as they struck up their close friendship.</li></ul><p>Scores of Buffett books have been written, but none can claim this work&#x2019;s combination of trust between two friends, the writer&#x2019;s deep under�standing of Buffett&#x2019;s world, and a very long-term perspective.</p></p><p><b>CAROL J. LOOMIS</b>&nbsp;is a senior editor-at-large at&nbsp;<i>Fortune,&nbsp;</i>where she has worked since 1954. She has been the magazine&#x2019;s expert on Warren Buf�fett since 1966 and has edited his annual letter to shareholders since 1977. Her many honors include five lifetime achievement awards, including a Gerald Loeb Award for business journalism and Time Inc.&#x2019;s first-ever Henry Luce Award. This is her first book. She lives in Westchester County.This anthology of works about Warren Buffett provides a thorough examination of one of the world&#39;s most successful business leaders. Culled from articles by Loomis that appeared in Fortune between 1966 and 2012, this collection provides an almost complete picture of all things Buffett. Narrator Susan Boyce hands in a strong, well-articulated performance, but her reading lacks the sort of emotion that would make this audio edition more engaging. Barry Press infuses his narration with more feeling, but fails to vary his pacing and emphasis. In all, this is an engaging collection of articles, but listeners may lose interest somewhere along the way. A Portfolio hardcover.

The common person reacts with pat answers; she casually dismisses others in their moments of weakness; she stays on the low road to build her case. </p><p>But the uncommon woman responds to God&#x2019;s love. She covers another&#x2019;s weakness, she chooses her battles wisely, she seeks the high road. She knows that Jesus is alive and active and willing to change her life.

The Uncommon Woman will show you how to be uncommon in your circumstance, regardless of the situation.

Annaka Harris has woven a beautiful tapestry of art, storytelling, and profound wisdom. Any young child and parent will benefit from sharing this wondrous book together.&#x201d; Daniel Goleman, author of the #1 bestseller <i>Emotional Intelligence</i></b><br><br><b> <i>I Wonder</i> captures the beauty of life and the mystery of our world, sweeping child and adult into a powerful journey of discovery. Magnificent!&#x201d; Daniel Siegel, author of <i>Mindsight</i> and <i>The Whole-Brain Child</i></b><br><br>Eva takes a walk with her mother and encounters a range of mysteries: from gravity, to life cycles, to the vastness of the universe. She learns that it&#x2019;s okay to say I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; and she discovers that there are some things even adults don&#x2019;t know mysteries for everyone to wonder about together! <i>I Wonder</i> is a book that celebrates the feelings of awe and curiosity in children, as the foundation for all learning.<br></p><p><b><i>I Wonder</i> Q&amp;A</b><br><br><b>Q: How did you choose the topics that are raised in <i>I Wonder</i>? Are the questions in the book based on conversations with your daughter or other children you&#x2019;ve worked with?</b><br><br>Harris: I was inspired by my many conversations with children over the years, especially my daughter. The search for the moon came directly from her, actually. She became very interested in the moon when she was 18 months old, and she was always pointing it out in the sky. If you look closely, you&#x2019;ll see that the moon is in every illustration in the book.<br><br>But the choice of topics was strategic. In addition to helping children say I don&#x2019;t know&#x201d; to more simple questions, I wanted to delve into the questions that inspire awe. To me, they arise from four types of mysteries: 1) fundamental forces that are mysterious, like gravity; 2) the mystery of something that can be known in principle but not in practice, such as the exact number of grains of sand; 3) the inherently mysterious quality of a concept like infinity, which is impossible for us to grasp intuitively no matter how much we may understand&#x201d; it mathematically; and 4) the mysteriousness of impermanence: life and death, the fact that everything is changing from one moment to the next, and the larger question of how something comes from nothing, or why there is something at all.<br><br>At the level of our emotional experience, fear and excitement are close cousins; I wanted to point to an alternative to the fearful reaction to these concepts that is so often modeled in our culture. They can be wonderful mysteries to <i>enjoy</i>!<br><b>Q: In the story, the mother asks the first question, rather than the child. Why did you begin the book this way?</b><br><br>Harris: I think it&#x2019;s important to ask children questions, guiding them in their investigations of the world, and to be interested in their unique thoughts about how things work. The book sends a message to parents that children don&#x2019;t have to be the only ones asking questions we can ask our children questions about the universe too! I also wanted to get to the child&#x2019;s experience of not knowing as early as possible, so I began the book by directly asking a question to which her response would naturally be I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; In fact, the original title for the book was <i>I Don&#x2019;t Know</i>. And finally, I thought it was important for children hearing the story to be reassured by the mother right away, when she says, It&#x2019;s okay to say, <i>I don&#x2019;t know</i>,&#x201d; laying the foundation for all of the subsequent conversations in the story.<br><b>Q: What was your goal in writing this book?</b><br><br>Harris: I wanted to give parents and educators tools to help very young children:<br>1) learn to identify the feeling of not knowing, and develop language for talking about it;<br>2) become aware of the positive feelings associated with not knowing awe and excitement;<br>3) learn to say I don&#x2019;t know&#x201d; with pride, rather than embarrassment or fear;<br>4) learn to ask questions;<br>5) begin to develop a capacity for postulating theories without censoring oneself;<br>6) learn to say I don&#x2019;t know&#x201d; by seeing it modeled in adults, which I believe is the most powerful way to teach children.<br><b>Q: When the mother tells Eva that no one knows where gravity comes from, it seems like people could misread this, coming away thinking you&#x2019;re saying we don&#x2019;t know <i>anything at all</i> about gravity. Are you worried about this miscommunication?</b><br><br>Harris: The main goal of the book was to model a new style of dialogue between adult and child. I wanted the book to be appropriate for the youngest children possible starting at 12 to 18 months while still addressing complex ideas. The part about gravity was difficult to write, because the challenge was to get to a fundamental force or interaction that I could say is still mysterious in some sense without being too wordy, or too complicated for young children, and still relating to Eva&#x2019;s walk. Given all the variables, I decided this was the best way to begin the conversation about mystery, and I&#x2019;m not too worried that the reader will think I&#x2019;m saying we know nothing about gravity. The point was for Eva to ask a question that not only her mother doesn&#x2019;t have the answer to, but nobody has the answer to. Something that inspires wonder, and something that unites all of humankind. A mystery for everyone to share.<br><b>Q: You say that you wrote <i> I Wonder </i> for adults as well as children. Can you explain more about why?</b><br><br>Harris: I think that we need to remind <i>ourselves</i> that it&#x2019;s okay to say I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; as much as we need to pass this message on to our children. We often have the most clarity and insight when talking to our children, and we&#x2019;re often reminding ourselves of the very lessons we&#x2019;re imparting to them in that moment. A good example of this is when we have a hard time separating when we&#x2019;re dropping our kids off at school for the first time, for example, and we say I know you&#x2019;re sad, but you&#x2019;re going to be okay. Your teachers are here to take care of you, and Mommy will be back soon!&#x201d; We often need this reassurance as much as they do. So I wrote this book with that in mind.<br><br>This book is something I wanted to create for parents to share with their children, which is different from writing a book primarily for children to enjoy. I wrote the story that I wasn&#x2019;t able to find on the bookstore shelves when I went looking for the book I wanted to read with my daughter. My assumption was that there were other parents out there who wanted a book like <i>I Wonder</i>. It was important to me to get the parent-child balance right, and it was a challenging task. I consulted with many developmental experts, children&#x2019;s book editors, scientists, parents, and children. I also selected the artist very carefully. I wanted to find the balance between a story that really speaks to parents and one that is engaging for children, and I think John Rowe did a spectacular job of helping to accomplish this.<br><br><b>Q: How did you choose the child&#x2019;s answer to the question Can you think of other things that change?&#x201d;</b><br><br>Harris: I wanted there to be room for an extended conversation between the adult and the child while reading the book. Each answer <i>clouds, frogs,</i> and <i>me </i> addresses the subject of impermanence and cycles in a different way. Clouds change right before our eyes and are always there to remind us of the ever-changing nature of things. Frogs go through distinct life cycles, which opens the door to a conversation about life and death. And the child&#x2019;s placing herself in the world is also important. Her simple answer in the book, ME!,&#x201d; leaves room for interpretation. She could be talking about her awareness of her own growth from a baby to a little girl, or her changes in mood, clothing, hair, etc. Each answer gives options for different directions in which to take the conversation. There are many answers and many ways to explain impermanence.<br><br>I encourage parents to build on all these concepts and conversations.

He had ambitions. He was happy. And he thought he could handle anything. <br>He was wrong. <br>When Jay falls in with a crowd that's dabbling in drugs and the occult, he finds himself in over his head and doing things he never thought possible. Fascinated by the dark arts and in love with a dangerous girl, Jay falls deeper and deeper into a life he no longer recognizes...and sees no way out.</p><p>Beatrice Sparks is a family and adolescent therapist who edited the diary that formed the basis for Go Ask Alice, and has since edited many diaries on topics such as gangs, AIDS, and teen pregnancy in the 1988 Annie&#39;s Baby. She lives in Provo, UT.<b>INTRODUCTION</b><br><br>At 7 A.M. January 3, 1978, a very distressed mother phoned. She said she had read an article about how I had prepared <i>Go Ask Alice</i> from an existing diary, and <i>Voices,</i> not then released, from personal interviews; how I hoped both books would help educate young people as to the problems and pressures and weaknesses of their peers, and make it easier for them to consider alternatives and make wise decisions in their own lives.<br><br>The lady said her son, Jay, had kept a journal&#x2014;a seminary book&#x2014;and many papers and letters, which she felt could also be of benefit to both kids and parents looking for answers and ways out.<br><br>Jay, l6 � years old, had been into witchcraft, how deeply neither his mother nor his father had ever suspected, until after Jay put his father&#x2019;s pistol against his right temple and pulled the trigger.<br><br>As Jay&#x2019;s mother and I plowed through the many containers of favorite footballs, basketballs, tennis rackets, trophies, diplomas, awards, letters, notes, books, etc., that she had not been able to part with, she remained calm and helpful. Only when she unfolded Jay&#x2019;s worn, stained &#x201c;grub jacket&#x201d; at the bottom of the last box did she cry; telling me how she had put the leather patches on the elbows after his motorbike had gone out of control and spilled down the slope and into a tree, how she had replaced the front pocket with an emblem he had picked up on a trip to Las Vegas, how he had stained the front lapel and shoulder helping his dad bring a deer down on a pole slung over both their shoulders, how he had made the long slash on the right arm when he had rescued their cat, Hamlet, from the top of a 200-foot tree, how the two stars over the left breast represented his &#x201c;eternal and forever&#x201d; buddies, Dell and Brad.<br><br>From the corner of the lining she patiently pulled out a half-eaten, linty M&amp;M and holding it, as reverently as though it were the Sacrament, she whispered almost to herself, <i>&#x201c;Jay always thought he could handle anything, everything!&#x201d;</i><br><br>Jay was an exceptionally intelligent and articulate boy, with an IQ of 149+. In his journal, he often worried that his best friends weren&#x2019;t able to handle things the way he could because of his detached, intellectual approach. He analyzed, composed lists, fought against giving in. But he was sometimes relieved when he didn&#x2019;t <i>have</i> to handle things&#x2014;drugs, alcohol, the occult, or even sex.<br><br>Jay&#x2019;s journal became his intimate confidante. In it, he felt free to express his confusions, his hopes, and his fears.<br><br>Hoping to fill in sketchy gaps in Jay&#x2019;s journal I interviewed many of his friends and teachers. As a whole they said he was a &#x201c;mostly just like everybody else&#x201d; boy. Three kids who had been into the occult with him seemed more skittish. As long as we were talking about school, dating, family, drugs, hobbies, or sports, they were relaxed and friendly, but when I tried to question them about witchcraft they changed, became frightened, secretive, withdrawn. Through bits and pieces I gathered that they were under some strange kind of &#x201c;sacrifice my own life or have it taken from me&#x201d; type of programming. They sincerely seemed to fear that I could bring harm to myself or my own kids if more information were divulged to me. Their obvious and abject terror was contagiously and hauntingly real. I wanted out and I wasn&#x2019;t even in!<br><br>Jay&#x2019;s mother&#x2019;s voice returns, <i>&#x201c;Jay always thought he could handle anything, everything!&#x201d;</i><br><br>That dirge, much more repeated than most people imagine, mixes with the lonely cry of every frightened little girl I ever worked with or talked to who found herself pregnant: &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t think it could happen to me!&#x201d;<br><br>The voice of every kid hooked on drugs, alcohol, or the occult joins the sad chorus, &#x201c;Not me! I didn&#x2019;t think it could ever happen to me. I WAS SURE I COULD HANDLE IT!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x2014;BEATRICE SPARKS<br><br><b>July 2</b><br><br>For two weeks now my Sunday school teacher and my scout master and everybody else have been on my ass to keep a journal. It&#x2019;s the biggie now! The new &#x201c;everybody&#x2019;s got to do it&#x201d; thing! Mom bought me this one and left it on my bed when the hassle first began. I know she expected me to be &#x201c;appreciative&#x201d; about something I didn&#x2019;t even want and more especially don&#x2019;t want to do! But like usual, <i>what I want</i> is not important, it&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m <i>supposed to do</i> that counts! The old man is always moaning about how he works his tail off for us, and how . . . Oh Judas, this isn&#x2019;t what you&#x2019;re supposed to put in a journal. You&#x2019;re supposed to put only good things that your kids and grandkids and all of posterity can read. Man, I don&#x2019;t want any kids if they&#x2019;re going to turn out, burn out, anything like me: sad, rebellious, angry, searching . . . searching . . . searching, and for what? I&#x2019;m going on fifteen years old and no answers yet have ever really satisfied me. I want more . . . and more . . . and more! But more what? What in the hell do I <i>really</i> want out of life? That&#x2019;s one of the things this dumb-ass journal is supposed to help me find out, but at this rate it&#x2019;s just going to get me into more rocking trouble than I&#x2019;m already in, if that&#x2019;s possible. If the kids read it they&#x2019;ll go tattling to Mom and Dad, and if <i>they</i> read it all hell will break loose and I&#x2019;ll get grounded for completely through the millennium. Crap, what kind of a monster have I started here?<br><br>I don&#x2019;t want anybody to know what a rotten bastard screwup I am, and always have been, probably from the beginning of time and before. I&#x2019;m trying to keep it from myself even! . . . yet here I am putting it all down in incriminating black and white . . . Judas, boredom is a drag, drag, drag. Writing might be good therapy for me in a way, though. Indeed, a means of getting hostile things out of my system. It seems like I&#x2019;m eternally out of sync . . . kind of like I always want to scream &#x201c;black&#x201d; when somebody says &#x201c;white,&#x201d; or whatever is, to quote the old man, &#x201c;argumentative, inappropriate, and revolutionary.&#x201d;<br><br>He wanted in<br><br>I wanted out<br><br>He had a smile<br><br>I had a pout<br><br>I need someone to understand<br><br>God, how I need a helping hand.<br><br>Man, if people are going to keep a journal they should do it when they&#x2019;re little, when all the good things happen, before life starts kicking you in the ass and in the head and every other place. When I was little before I even knew how to write was the only time things happened that were worth writing about. No, I remember going to Disneyland with the family when I was bigger, and going on fishing trips and on the deer hunts with my mom&#x2019;s brothers and sisters and my dad&#x2019;s relatives. We would all meet up at Big Pines and have a campground where the kids ran like wild Indians through the brush and streams and groves while the dads and big boys went up into the very tops of the mountains. Judas, it was exciting when they brought their deer down across their backs or on the tote-goat. The girls would gag and shudder while they cut the heads off and skinned the things and we guys would rub salt into the pelts with rocks and have the greatest times ever.<br><br>But then somehow I got into seventh grade and started smoking shit and stuff and I don&#x2019;t know, I guess it really was in seventh grade when I started getting off the track. Man, it all seems so strange now, when I was in first and second and third grade I was so square and religious and everything. I&#x2019;d looked forward to being a deacon for as long as I can remember&#x2014;I really wanted to pass the Sacrament! And I&#x2019;d been saving my money to go on a mission since I first knew what money was.<br><br>I was so sincere then, and I tried so hard to conform. At least a part of me did. What happened to that sweet little kid? Whatever&#x2014;ever happened to that nice little boy that I will never know again? I feel sad, like someone has died, maybe a part of me has . . . the good part.<br><br><b>January 7</b><br><br>Hi, you dumb bastard old journal:<br><br>I haven&#x2019;t written in you for six months, haven&#x2019;t even thought about you in fact, until tonight when I&#x2019;m so bored I&#x2019;m about to fall out of my tree. Judas, when I remembered I had hid you up in the attic, under the insulation by the crawl hole in my bedroom, it was like rediscovering an old friend. How&#x2019;s that for being lonely? Being grounded is really the shits. I&#x2019;ve been imprisoned for a week and I&#x2019;ve read and studied and drawn till I&#x2019;m about to go stir-crazy, all because I punched Kendall out for getting in my room and messing up my stuff. I just threw him out in the hall after I&#x2019;d already told him a hundred million times to bug off. How in hell was I supposed to know he&#x2019;d land the wrong way and break his arm?<br><br>The saddest thing is that everybody acts like I broke it on purpose. They should all know me well enough to know I wouldn&#x2019;t . . . I couldn&#x2019;t . . . do anything like that. They forget it was me that jumped in after him when he fell into the Snake River in Yellowstone Park; and me that packed him down the mountain when he ran through the patch of poison ivy and got it in his eyes and stuff; and me that always fixes his bicycle when the chain comes off or it has a flat or . . . Oh God, he&#x2019;s such a neat little guy and I feel <i>sooooooooo</i> bad inside. I wish like everything it was my arm that was busted! I&#x2019;d even sit right here and break both my arms if I thought that would help any. I really would!<br><br>I&#x2019;m sorry . . . <i>sorry</i> . . . SORRY AS HELL! Man, I&#x2019;m sorry! I don&#x2019;t know why I can&#x2019;t tell any of them that though. It&#x2019;s like I speak Chinese and they all speak Russian or some screwup thing. They don&#x2019;t understand! They don&#x2019;t think I &#x201c;care,&#x201d; I &#x201c;hurt,&#x201d; or I &#x201c;have feelings.&#x201d; It just seems like I&#x2019;m always wrong, always &#x201c;selfish,&#x201d; always &#x201c;self-centered,&#x201d; and everything else that&#x2019;s negative and destructive. Oh dear God, I don&#x2019;t want to be all these things. Please somebody help me not to be them. I want to be loved and treated special and stuff like the little kids are. Will it ever be that way again? <i>Can</i> it ever again be for me like it was when I was little?<br><br><b>January 14</b><br><br>I had an IQ test in school today and it&#x2019;s 149+. Man, that makes me so proud! A genius! Me a genius! Well, almost. I found out by accident when I heard the teacher talking to the guy who gives the tests. I was walking down the hall being loud, trying to get a little attention for my old mismatched self, hitting guys and pushing girls, saying weird, gross things, just being old goofy loony me, maybe even more obnoxious than usual because Brad and Dell were both out with the flu. In a way I&#x2019;m kind of glad Brad and Dell weren&#x2019;t with me when I found out about my IQ because . . . well, it&#x2019;s hard to be different. I checked under Intelligence Quotient in the library and only 7 percent of privileged kids are high as me. That&#x2019;s scary. I&#x2019;m afraid of being different. It&#x2019;s hard enough to exist when you feel mostly like everybody else. Nobody wants to be different, even good different. I want to be like Brad and Dell! We pretend we&#x2019;re the Three Nephites. We three against the world! Out to avenge all wrongs! Since we&#x2019;ve been in kindergarten we&#x2019;ve been best friends, more than friends . . . buddies . . . brothers. . . . One time we were talking seriously and decided we must have been friends in heaven before we came to this world. I can&#x2019;t imagine heaven being heaven without those two guys. I really can&#x2019;t. I know that sounds dumb-assed and harebrained, very me-like, but I&#x2019;m not really a <i>whole</i> person without them. I&#x2019;m beginning to sound like my Sunday school teacher. . . . Crap on crap I don&#x2019;t need that!<br><br>I guess actually this high IQ thing is a big responsibility. I really am going to try to live up to it. I&#x2019;m going to improve my vocabulary and try to be more colorful and picturesque in my speech. I think next fall I&#x2019;ll try to get on the debating team.

Instead of the global meltdown seen in today&#x2019;s society, the Lord promises to send His grace on our nation, other nations, and the church.

The author of ten inspirational books, Goddard was a popular speaker on metaphysical themes. In his 1952 publication <i>The Power of Awareness, </i>he voiced many of the ideas that are now in the mainstream of contemporary self-help circles, including the concept that your thoughts control your destiny and that in order to change your current physical state you must first change your mind. His ten easy exercises help readers cultivate a positive attitude that makes all things possible.<br>This edition features another of Goddard's empowering titles, <i>Awakened Imagination, </i>in which the author expounds upon his belief that Christ is within each of us and can help us achieve our desires through imaginative effort. Goddard illuminates his philosophy with quotations from Yeats, Blake, and the Bible as well as inspiring anecdotes of his personal experiences.</p><p>Neville Goddard (1905&#x2013;72) was born in Barbados and came to the United States at the age of 17 to pursue his interest in dance and drama. His study of Hebrew, scripture, and kabbalah with an Ethiopian rabbi led to his development of a philosophy of mental creativity. Although often associated with the New Thought movement, Goddard claimed no affiliation with any group. A popular speaker on metaphysical themes, he wrote ten inspirational books and appeared frequently on television and radio.</p><h2>Children&#39;s Illustrated Animal Atlas (Children&#39;s Illustrated Atlas)</h2><p><p>A thrilling animal adventure around the globe, packed with maps and facts and that is perfect for kids ages 6&#x2013;8.</p><p>With more than 40 full-color maps, <i>Children's Illustrated Animal Atlas</i> zooms in on countries and continents to show key animal habitats and locations around the world.</p><p>Photographs highlight each continent's most iconic animals, and colorful graphics take a closer look, showing the animals and plants found within each territory.

True poetry about perceiving the world around us."*</strong></p><p>Margaret Wise Brown, the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of the perennial classics <em>Goodnight Moon </em>and <em>Runaway Bunny</em>, asks children to think deeply about the importance of everyday objects, from apples to spoons. With lyrical words and vivid illustrations by Caldecott winner Leonard Weisgard, <em>The Important Book</em> shows children just how important everyday objects can be.</p><p>What is the most important thing about a spoon? The fact that you can eat with it? What about an apple? Or a shoe? This book<em> </em>helps curious preschoolers notice important details about their everyday surroundings, like daisies are white, rain is wet, and a spoon is used for eating.</p><p>For the important thing about&nbsp;<em>The Important Book</em>&nbsp;is that the book resonates long after it's closed. What's most important about many familiar things&#x2014;like rain and wind, apples and daisies&#x2014;is suggested in rhythmic words and vivid pictures. "A perfect book. The text establishes a word game which tiny children will accept with glee," said <em>Kirkus</em>.</p><p>Chosen as a "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children" by the American&nbsp;National Education Association.</p><p><em>(*</em><em>Mark Frauenfelder</em><em>, BoingBoing magazine)</em></p></p><p><blockquote><i> "The important thing about rain is/ that it is wet./ It falls out of the sky,/ and it sounds like rain,/ and makes things shiny,/ and it does not taste like anything,/ and is the color of air./ But the important thing about rain is that it is wet."</i> </blockquote><p> <i>Goodnight Moon</i> creator Margaret Wise Brown's <i>The Important Book</i> is a deceptively simple exercise--taking familiar things like an apple, spoon, or shoe, and finding the most basic association with those things. The most important thing about an apple? It is round. A spoon? You eat with it. A shoe? You put your foot in it. But why, according to Brown, is the most important thing about grass "that it is green," while the most important thing about an apple is "that it is round"? Why is "that it is white" the most important thing about snow <i>and</i> a daisy? Whether or not you'd distill these things in the same way that the author does, Brown makes us think about the essence of everyday entities in new ways. The illustrations, by Caldecott Medal winner Leonard Weisgard (<i>The Little Island</i>), perform the same function--capturing the spoonness of spoons, the roundness of an apple, the motion of wind.</p><p> Happily, Brown went on to create the companion <i>Another Important Book</i>, about the importance of being one, two, three, four, five, and six years old--published for the first time in 1999 with fabulous artwork by Caldecott Honor artist Chris Raschka (<i>Yo! Yes?</i>). Both of Brown's "important books" will endure the test of time as fresh, thought-provoking ways to examine the world around us. (Click to see a sample spread.

(Preschool and older) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p><p>The important thing about <em> The Important Book</em> -- is that you let your child tell you what is important about the sun and the moon and the wind and the rain and a bug and a bee and a chair and a table and a pencil and a bear and a rainbow and a cat <em>(if he wants to).</em> For the important thing about <em> The Important Book</em> is that the book goes on long after it is closed.What is most important about many familiar things -- like rain and wind, apples and daisies -- is suggested in rhythmic words and vivid pictures.

This much-anticipated second edition of a best-selling book is your guide to help prevent that. Some of our brightest, most creative children and adults are misdiagnosed as having behavioral or emotional disorders such as ADD/ADHD, Oppositional Defiant Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, or Asperger's Disorder.

The heart of this area&#x2014;the Acadiana region of Louisiana&#x2014;is a tough land that funnels its spirit into the local cuisine. You can&#x2019;t find more delicious, rustic, and satisfying country cooking than the dirty rice, spicy sausage, and fresh crawfish that this area is known for. It takes a homegrown guide to show us around the back roads of this particularly unique region, and in <i>Real Cajun</i>, James Beard Award&#x2013;winning chef Donald Link shares his own rough-and-tumble stories of living, cooking, and eating in Cajun Country. <br><br>Link takes us on an expedition to the swamps and smokehouses and the music festivals, funerals, and holiday celebrations, but, more important, reveals the fish fries, �touff�es, and pots of Granny&#x2019;s seafood gumbo that always accompany them. The food now famous at Link&#x2019;s New Orleans&#x2013;based restaurants, Cochon and Herbsaint, has roots in the family dishes and traditions that he shares in this book. You&#x2019;ll find recipes for Seafood Gumbo, Smothered Pork Roast over Rice, Baked Oysters with Herbsaint Hollandaise, Louisiana Crawfish Boudin, quick and easy Flaky Buttermilk Biscuits with Fig-Ginger Preserves, Bourbon-Soaked Bread Pudding with White and Dark Chocolate, and Blueberry Ice Cream made with fresh summer berries. Link throws in a few lagniappes to give you an idea of life in the bayou, such as strategies for a great trip to Jazz Fest, a what-not-to-do instructional on catching turtles, and all you ever (or never) wanted to know about boudin sausage. Colorful personal essays enrich every recipe and introduce his grandfather and friends as they fish, shrimp, hunt, and dance. <br><br>From the backyards where crawfish boils reign as the greatest of outdoor events to the white tablecloths of Link&#x2019;s famed restaurants, <i>Real Cajun</i> takes you on a rollicking and inspiring tour of this wild part of America and shares the soulful recipes that capture its irrepressible spirit.</p><p>DONALD LINK is the chef-owner of Herbsaint and Cochon in New Orleans.

Whether it&#x2019;s a holiday, funeral, family reunion, or potluck dinner, you can bet there will be at least one form of dirty rice or rice dressing. At the Link family reunion in Robert&#x2019;s Cove, I counted six versions, all different. The essential ingredients are few, but flavor and texture vary greatly.<br> <br>The main difference between dirty rice and rice dressing is that rice dressing is generally made with ground beef or pork, whereas dirty rice is made with pork and chicken livers. Many people think they don&#x2019;t like liver, but when it&#x2019;s balanced with other flavors, the liver taste is not overpowering. I&#x2019;ve served this deeply flavored rice to many people who claim they hate liver, only to have them love it.<br> <br>2 tablespoons canola oil<br>4 ounces ground pork<br>1/2 cup chicken livers (about 4 ounces), pureed1 <br>1/2 teaspoons salt<br>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>1/2 teaspoon chili powder<br>1 1/2 cups chicken broth<br>1 small onion, finely chopped<br>2 celery stalks, finely chopped<br>2 garlic cloves, minced<br>1 jalape�o pepper, stemmed, seeded, and finely chopped<br>1 tablespoon dried oregano<br>3 cups cooked rice<br>1/2 bunch scallions (white and green parts), chopped<br>2 tablespoons chopped parsley<br> <br>Heat the oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil is hot, add the pork and chicken livers and cook, stirring, until browned. Add the salt, black pepper, and chili powder and stir often, but resist the impulse to stir constantly: You want the meat to stick to the pan and get crusty. Add � cup of the chicken broth and cook until it has evaporated, allowing the meat mixture to get browned and crusty and stick to the pan once again. Add the onion, celery, garlic, jalape�o, and oregano and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are nicely browned and crusty and beginning to stick to the pan. Add the rice, the remaining 1 � cups broth, the scallions, and parsley. Stir until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is heated through.<br> <br>NOTE: When making dishes that involve rice, remember that your flavor base will seem overly seasoned until the rice absorbs the flavors. In Cajun cooking, salt is the most crucial ingredient to get right, so you&#x2019;ll want to taste the dish after the rice cooks and adjust accordingly.</p><h2>The Crocheted Prayer Shawl Companion: 37 Patterns to Embrace, Inspire, and Celebrate Life</h2><p><p>The <strong>Prayer Shawl Ministry</strong> is an extraordinary group that has touched lives in extraordinary ways across the world for more than a decade.

That is to say, when the individual . . . does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves.<br>&#x2015;Carl Jung<br></em>My father had two very distinct personalities. The same father who tenderly gave me caf� au lait on a spoon and fresh-squeezed orange juice in a baby glass, who listened to my childish sentences with such pride and pleasure, who dreamed impossible dreams for my future and worked all of his life to give me the best of everything&#x2015;that same beloved father had a monster living inside of him. And that monster was as frightening to me as the other side of him was beautiful. And that monster grew stronger with each drink he took. At different times of the month, the week, and eventually the day, the monster would take over my father, and I would have no idea where my 'real' dad had gone. <br><br>Now and then, the monster in him would break loose and dance with the monster in all of us. The monster roared its terrible roar and sat in my father's chair in the living room. And I was, somehow, this monster's child. We each, at one time or another, shared his private hell with him until all of us lost our grip on normal.<br><br>But still, this was my family, my dad, my monster, and I had to do something to make emotional and psychological sense of living with a parent who made me feel both safe and terrified; a parent whom I loved and hated all at once. All children are faced with integrating parts of their parents that they both love and hate, but for the child in the alcoholic home, this becomes a uniquely challenging and daily experience. <br><br>When Dad went to (and left) treatment, there was no such thing as family healing. The wisdom of the day was essentially 'get the alcoholic sober and the rest of the family will get better automatically.' But that didn't happen. It didn't happen because the de-selfing experience of living on an emotional roller coaster had left us not knowing what normal life felt like. The healthy boundary that once surrounded the sweet and secure membrane of our lives was invaded and degraded by the disease of addiction. Just as we had a drunken father and a sober one, we had a drunken family and a sober one. It was as if we repeatedly passed behind some invisible curtain, reemerging each time into an alternate universe but still in our same, familiar living room. The scenes looked somewhat the same, but they felt different. Just maneuvering in and through these worlds required creative, complex, zany, and sometimes rather dysfunctional strategies. <br><br>We had no idea, in the 1960s, of how deeply affected an entire family becomes, how the trauma of living with the daily disruptions, distortions, and denial of addiction wraps its tentacles around childhood development and family development, changing everyone. But it doesn't have to be that way. Today we have something called recovery. Today we recognize that there is no dignity in hiding the truth and no freedom in keeping secrets. We learn, in recovery, to stand up and take responsibility for the part of the disease that lives in us and to take the necessary steps to treat it. And in doing this, we restore our hope, faith, and trust in life.<br><br>It is impossible to explain to someone who has not been through it how many little things go awry in a home where addiction has taken hold. Sure, I can say routines were thrown off; there was constant crisis that wasn't there before, but that doesn't fully describe it. What really hurts is that you can no longer count on anyone the way that you once did. You watch the parent you love turn the face that once smiled at you towards a bottle of alcohol or sink into a lying and degrading behavior. And then, just as mysteriously, he returns, clean-shaven, loving you once again, and remembering all the things you worried he had forgotten--that you're in a school play, what you like for breakfast, that you are still there (even though he comes and goes). You have him back. You're torn between letting it feel wonderful (which it does) and not letting it feel too good, because you know from experience that if it feels too good it will only hurt more when he slips away again. Then sure enough, you sense tension creeping in, you see situations devolving and unraveling before your eyes, and you know that it's coming. You can read all the signs. The gap between the worlds that had temporarily closed up begins to widen, and your addict disappears into some crevice, some wormhole in the universe, and he is gone as mysteriously as he came. He returns to his private nowhere where you can't find him. He hides in plain sight. And you have to lose him once again. And wait to see what happens. And just be in the family that is still there. Somewhat there. You see the disappointment on the faces around you; you see the confusion, the humiliation and the hurt. And simultaneously you see those family members shake their heads, square their shoulders, and mush on because the world is still chugging along even though the alcoholic has stepped off. You both appreciate and hate their efforts. You appreciate the ones who are able to plow through, even with blinders, because someone has to, because there are school buses to make, homework to be done, and appointments to get to. You hate it because you sense the sham underneath it. The pain inside you, inside everyone grows. But no one talks about it; because what would they say? It is too sad to look at, too much to sort out.<br><br>And changing one person might mean everyone has to change. And what would that mean--what would it look like and who would everyone be then? And besides, the family loses track of what's wrong. Is it even the alcohol you are looking at? Or the debting? Or the sexual liaisons and secrets? You hardly know any more. Addicts are so good at hiding their disease that for years it simply reads as their personality, their 'depression,' their 'negativity,' their 'expansive personality.'<br><br>The Japanese said it most succinctly: 'First the man takes the drink, then the drink takes the drink, then the drink takes the man.' And I would add that then the drink or disease takes the family. This disease is contagious. It's not only the addict who needs to sober up. Family members, too, need to become emotionally sober. Today, because treatment is so much more common, its progression can be caught before it spreads through the whole family. But the longer a family remains silent, in denial and living in the throes of managing the mind-numbing disease of addiction, the more symptomatic family members are likely to become.<br><br>Adult children of alcoholics (ACoAs) can and often do suffer from some features of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) that are the direct result of living with the traumatizing effects of addiction. Years after we leave behind our alcoholic homes, we carry the impact of living with addiction with us. We import past, unresolved pain into present-day relationships, but without much awareness as to how or why. And that is what this book is about. How living with addiction or dysfunction creates cumulative trauma, the effects of which can play out over a life time. And what to do to get better. And how getting better will open doors inside of you that you hardly knew were there.<br><strong><br>Family Trauma Need Not Be a Life Sentence</strong><br>Trauma is actually fairly common; most people grow up with at least four adverse childhood experiences (Anda 2006). It is not necessarily the trauma that creates lasting problematic effects, but how we deal with it (or don't deal with it) when it occurs and afterward. Much can be done to ameliorate the effects of adverse childhood experiences. Supportive people, places to go that feel safe, and moving shock into some form of consciousness so pain does not remain hidden and unspoken can take a situation that could be traumatic and turn it into something that might be less damaging and potentially even character building. <br><br>Our culture creates a sort of myth of 'happily ever after' that is really no one's life. Feeling sad, anxious, or fearful is part of the human condition and does not necessarily require treatment. What makes trauma different from normal life stressors is that its effects tend to be long-lasting and repetitive and the patterns that are associated with a traumatic circumstance make their way through the generations. Our shock is long-lasting, engraved in our neurological systems and evidenced by how easily we can be triggered, how quickly our emotions go from zero to ten. We experience a loss of neuromodulation, which translates into our losing some of our ability to self regulate. Feelings, even intense ones, come and go; but unresolved, hidden and unprocessed trauma can last.<br><br>Because of the way the brain processes trauma, our most painful experiences may be the very ones that get repressed or thrown out of conscious awareness. While initially this allows us to function during overwhelming experiences that might otherwise immobilize us, eventually those feelings of fear and anxiety need to be felt rather than frozen. The family, while a perfect unit for raising young, can also be fertile ground for creating cumulative trauma throughout the developmental cycle. Our primary relationships are meant to nurture and sustain us until we are strong enough to survive on our own. When small children are terrified by the very same people who they would normally go to for comfort and safety, they become trapped in a confusing and disequilibrating system with no one to help them to restore their sense of 'normal' and their feeling of emotional balance. They are then forced to come up with immature strategies to manage what feels unmanageable. Oftentimes they just go numb. Or they dissociate; they disappear on the inside.<br><br>Recovery from the ACoA trauma syndrome is all about reclaiming the fragmented parts of self that are trapped in another psychological and emotional time and place and bringing them into the here and now. It is translating hidden emotion into words so that feelings can be processed, new insight and meaning can be gained, and experiences can be knitted back together with new understanding into a coherent and present-oriented picture of the functioning self and the self in relation to others. It is learning to live in the present rather than in the past or future.<br><br>This field has many pioneers whose remarkable sharing and collaborations over the years have lit a lamp for others to follow. Some of these pioneers are Margaret Cork, Claudia Black, Sharon Wegscheider-Cruse, Robert Ackerman, Jane Middleton-Moz, Stephanie Brown, Don Coyhis, Jerry Moe, Janet Woititz, Rokelle Lerner, Faye Calhoun, Jeannette Johnson, Phil Diaz, Patricia O'Gorman, Frances Brisbane, Stephanie Covington, Anna Whiting Sorrel, Hoover Adger, Lala Strassner, Cathleen Brooks Weiss, Ann Smith, Ellen Morehouse, Patrick Carnes, John Bradshaw, and Timmen Cermak. <br><br>Research on trauma made my own work come alive and provided a research base that began my own exploration of what I call the ACoA Trauma Syndrome; much gratitude to Bessel van der Kolk, Judith Hermann, and Lisa Najavitts for their seminal work in this area. Another leg of the stool that the syndrome stands on is attachment research, which I apply to my understanding of how childhood development is affected by growing up with addiction. Those in the area of attachment by whom I have been led are Maria Montessori, Jonathon Bowlby, D. W. Winnicott, Alan Schore, Stanley Greenspan, and Daniel Siegel. Robert Anda's research on Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) has elevated awareness and brought attention to the long-term impact that growing up with addiction can have on both mental and physical health, making an invaluable contribution toward policy in this area. <br><br>Psychodrama is my method of treating people who have been traumatized or people simply looking to increase their own level of spontaneity, creativity, and aliveness. In this area I have been most impacted by J. L. Moreno, Zerka Moreno, and Dr. Robert Siroka, whose excellent training and vision for this method lit my own healing spirit. <br><br>It is my hope that by the end of this book you will have an in-depth understanding of trauma; it is also my hope that reading this book will help to make trauma seem less strange and threatening to cope with and help you to develop various strategies for lifestyles that both minimize its occurrence and intensity and process it before it comes to have a life of its own. In Part 1, we discuss and draw pictures of the black-and-white world of the family system that contains addiction. In Part II, you will learn how your mind and body become affected and infected through living with the trauma-engendering dysfunctional relationship dynamics that surround addiction. In Part III, we explore case studies involving process addictions or the many forms of compulsive behaviors that self-medication can assume.<br><br>In Part IV, we'll take a step down the path of healing from the <em>ACoA Trauma Syndrome</em> and offer tips on attitude and lifestyle changes that build resilience and strength. In Part V, we'll look at ways of breaking the intergenerational chain of pain. We'll see how the past can be separated from the present so that we can live with mindful, positive purpose in the here and now.<br>Many who embrace recovery come to experience it as a journey of self-discovery, one of expansion into a new sense of self, self in relationships, and meaning and purpose in life. Many find that the promises of twelve step program do come true and they 'do not regret nor wish to close the door' on their past, because through processing it, they have come to a deeper sense of aliveness and self-confidence. Or as Edmund Spenser wrote in The Faeire Queene, 'For whatsoever from one place doth fall, Is with the tide unto an other brought: For there is nothing lost, that may be found, if sought.'</p> <p>&nbsp;�2012 Tian Dayton, PhD.

In a world forever at odds, his rules for anticipating the motivations and strategies of our competitors never cease to inspire leaders of all kinds.</p><p>Michael Nylan, in her provocative introduction, sees new and unexpected lessons to be learned from <em>The Art of War</em>&#x2015;in business ventures, relationships, games of skill, academic careers, and medical practices. Strategy, like conflict is woven into society&#x2019;s very roots.</p><p>Nylan&#x2019;s crisp translation &#x201c;offers a masterly new evaluation of this classic work, which balances the overtly military content with a profound and thought-provoking analysis&#x201d; (Olivia Milburn). Readers newly engaging with ancient Chinese culture will be inspired by Nylan&#x2019;s authoritative voice. Informed by years of scholarly study, Nylan is uniquely placed to introduce readers to Sun Tzu&#x2019;s classic work through her detailed annotations on culture and the intricacies of translating ancient Chinese into modern English. She proves that Sun Tzu is more relevant than ever, helping us navigate the conflicts we know and those we have yet to endure.</p> 1 map</p><p>Michael Nylan is a professor of early Chinese history at the University of California, Berkeley, from Lexington, Kentucky. Her books include The Five &#x201c;Confucian? Classics, China&#x2019;s Early Empires, Analects: A Norton Critical Edition, The Canon of Supreme Mystery, Exemplary Figures, and Documents Classic.&#x201c;I consumed Professor Nylan&#x2019;s edition of <em>The Art of War</em> in one sitting! Sun Tzu has been so often translated that we run the risk of forgetting just how gripping and remarkable his little book is. The most impressive thing about the Nylan translation is its total lack of complacency&#x2015;it&#x2019;s the sharpest and most uncompromising English-language rendition of this book I've ever read.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steve Donoghue, managing editor, <em>Open Letters Monthly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Nylan&#x2019;s translation is marvelous. The pithiness of certain parts of the text, its aphoristic quality, presents an exceptionally difficult challenge. Because Nylan has a deep understanding of the social and cultural milieu that produced Sun Tzu&#x2019;s treatise, she has created an English-language version that is accessible while retaining the literary beauty of the original. Her introduction and supporting materials are very helpful to the reader, and I would expect that this version will become the standard one in the field.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dennis Washburn, translator of <em>The Tale of Genji</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Michael Nylan&#x2019;s masterful translation of <em>The Art of War</em> brings historical depth to our understanding of the classic and also illuminates its broad significance for our world today.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Waiy-yee Li, professor of Chinese literature, Harvard University</strong></p><h2>Unnatural Creatures: Stories Selected by Neil Gaiman</h2><p><p><strong><em>Unnatural Creatures</em> is a collection of short stories about the fantastical things that exist only in our minds&#x2014;collected and introduced by beloved <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author Neil Gaiman.</strong><br>&nbsp;<br>The sixteen stories gathered by Gaiman, winner of the Hugo and Nebula Awards, range from the whimsical to the terrifying.&nbsp;Magical creatures from the werewolf, to the sunbird,&nbsp;to beings never before classified will thrill, delight, and quite possibly unnerve you in&nbsp;tales by E.

Miss Haley is the mother of two children -- Marguerite, age two, and another born shortly after she completed this <i>A Story, a story</i>. The idea for <i>A Story, a Story</i>&nbsp;came to Miss Haley as a result of living in the Caribbean. There she found stories in which tigers and leopards appeared. These, happily, are not part of the Caribbean fauna. And so she traced the origins of these stories back to their sources in Africa. She studied African folklore and culture in preparation for writing and illustrating this book, and to capture the flavor of the languages, the people, their customs and life styles. The woodcuts that illustrate this book were cut and printed by Miss Haley in her own print shop.

Covered head-to-toe in strict, modest clothing, she received a rigorous education at Alta Academy, the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints' school headed by Warren Jeffs. Always seeking to be an obedient Priesthood girl, in her teens she became the nineteenth wife of her people's prophet: 85-year-old Rulon Jeffs, Warren's father. Finally sickened by the abuse she suffered and saw around her, she pulled off a daring escape and sought to build a new life and family. <br><br>The church, however, had a way of pulling her back in-and by 2007, Rebecca had no choice but to take the witness stand against the new prophet of the FLDS in order to protect her little sisters and other young girls from being forced to marry at shockingly young ages. The following year, Rebecca and the rest of the world watched as a team of Texas Rangers raided the Yearning for Zion Ranch, a stronghold of the FLDS. Rebecca's subsequent testimony would reveal the horrific secrets taking place behind closed doors of the temple, sending their leaders to prison for years, and Warren Jeffs for life. <br><br>THE WITNESS WORE RED is a gripping account of one woman's struggle to escape the perverse embrace of religious fanaticism and sexual slavery, and a courageous story of hope and transformation.</p><p>Rebecca Musser speaks nationally on behalf of oppressed women and is the founder of Claim Red, a non-profit organization.

This book arose not only out of countless hours of treating patients with dissociative disorders, but also out of the crucible of supervision and consultation, where therapists bring their most urgent questions, needs, and vulnerabilities.&nbsp;</p><p>The book offers an overview of the neuropsychology of dissociation as a disorder of non-realization, as well as chapters on assessment, prognosis, case formulation, treatment planning, and treatment phases and goals, based on best practices. The authors describe what to focus on first in a complex therapy, and how to do it; how to help patients establish both internal and external safety without rescuing; how to work systematically with dissociative parts of a patient in ways that facilitate integration rather than further dissociation; how to set and maintain helpful boundaries; specific ways to stay focused on process instead of content; how to deal compassionately and effectively with disorganized attachment and dependency on the therapist; how to help patients integrate traumatic memories; what to do when the patient is enraged, chronically ashamed, avoidant, or unable to trust the therapist; and how to compassionately understand and work with resistances as a co-creation of both patient and therapist.</p><p>Relational ways of being with the patient are the backbone of treatment, and are themselves essential therapeutic interventions. As such, the book also focused not only on highly practical and theoretically sound interventions, not only on what to do and say, but places strong emphasis on how to be with patients, describing innovative, compassionately collaborative approaches based on the latest research on attachment and evolutionary psychology.</p><p>Throughout the book, core concepts&#x2015;fundamental ideas that are highlighted in the text in bold so they can be seen at a glance&#x2015;are emphasized. These serve as guiding principles in treatment as well as a summing-up of many of the most important notions in each chapter. Each chapter concludes with a section for further examination. These sections include additional ideas and questions, exercises for practicing skills, and suggestions for peer discussions based on topics in a particular chapter, meant to inspire further curiosity, discovery, and growth.</p></p><p><p><strong>Kathy Steele, MN, CS</strong>, is in private practice with Metropolitan Psychotherapy Associates in Atlanta, Georgia.

But do you know Maria?</p><p> With gorgeous, Peruvian-inspired illustrations and English and Spanish retellings, Angela Dominguez gives a fresh new twist to the classic rhyme. Maria and her mischievous little llama will steal your heart.</p></p><p><p><b>Angela Dominguez</b> was born in Mexico City, grew up in the great state of Texas, and now resides in San Francisco. She has illustrated four previous books for children. As a child, she loved reading books and making a mess creating pictures. She's delighted to still be doing both.</p>Dominguez, a Mexican American illustrator, adapts the familiar rhyme &#x201c;Mary Had a Little Lamb&#x201d; to a new, Peruvian setting and offers each verse in both English and Spanish. When Maria&#x2019;s white llama follows her to school, the students are amused, but the teacher sends him outdoors. He waits patiently while the teacher explains that the llama loves Maria because Maria loves the llama. Kudos to Dominguez for using the entire poem rather than just the familiar opening verses. On the other hand, there is no mention of the original authorship. Using distinctive features of Andean dress, culture, and landscape (at one point the characters stand of a map of Peru), the gouache-and-ink illustrations feature bold lines and simple forms. Dominguez uses color effectively, with the white llama and Maria&#x2019;s bright red cap making them easy to spot. With its cheerful combination of fresh and familiar elements, this distinctive version of the rhyme makes a fine addition to library collections, particularly where there is a demand for bilingual picture books.

The wilder and more ridiculous something is, however, the firmer and more solid the evidence will have to be.<br><br>&#x2014;Isaac Asimov<br>We&#x2019;re living in a golden age of behavioral science, where every passing week seems to deliver fresh insights into the way we think, feel, and act. Neuroscientists, psychologists, and economists are busy unraveling the important mysteries of our time, questions like: &#x201c;How can I conquer my inbox?&#x201d; &#x201c;Why do perfectly reasonable people get their wires crossed?&#x201d; &#x201c;What would it take for me to stop procrastinating right now (or later today, or tomorrow)?&#x201d; Scientific research has ever more to say in answer to these sorts of pressing questions.<br><br>You might reasonably wonder what&#x2019;s changed. Why are so many media articles suddenly illustrated with pictures of brains? The three disciplines that form the backbone of this book�-psychology, behavioral economics, and neuroscience�-have been around for a century or more, after all. But right now we&#x2019;re sitting at the intersection of some big trends that are making these three behavioral sciences more applicable to our everyday lives. Let me describe some of that backstory, before I lay out the three big cross�cutting science themes that run through the rest of the book.<br>Psychology: Greater Focus on Well�Being<br><br>For much of its history, psychology was mostly concerned with investigating the causes of negative behavior. Researchers did important work to understand pathologies such as paranoia and depression; they explored the dynamics of fear and aggression. Given this, it&#x2019;s perhaps no surprise that one of psychology&#x2019;s most well�known experiments was Stanley Milgram&#x2019;s controversial exploration of how far people were willing to submit to authority�-the one where he tested whether volunteers would be willing to give potentially fatal electrical shocks to strangers when told to do so by someone in a white coat.1 (A disturbing number of them obeyed.) Obviously, this kind of research did a lot to illuminate the complexities of the human mind, and has laid the foundations of modern behavioral science. But the findings didn&#x2019;t readily translate into uplifting guidance for living a good life.<br><br>In recent years, however, the balance has shifted toward exploring the conditions that invite positive behavior. Perhaps the most visible catalyst for the shift came when Martin Seligman, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, was elected president of the American Psychological Association in 1998. Seligman&#x2019;s own research had previously focused on the study of helplessness. But he announced with some fanfare that the theme for his term of office would be &#x201c;positive psychology,&#x201d; the serious study of what it takes for us to be the best version of ourselves. And since then, psychologists have directed more energy toward understanding the jollier side of human experience�-what helps us thrive, lifts our spirits, and boosts our productivity. These are exactly the sort of things that most of us are hungry to know more about, especially on those days when our workplaces feel like a Milgram experiment.<br>Economics: More Realism in Theories of Behavior<br><br>At the same time, economics has also moved toward a more rounded view of the human condition. At its heart, economics is the study of the way people make choices: how we weigh the costs and benefits of different options, and what we decide to do as a result. The choices might be mundane, like deciding which snack to buy, or they might be consequential, like deciding which multimillion�dollar project goes forward. Either way, to predict people&#x2019;s choices, economists used to build theoretical models that assumed humans always accurately and independently assessed the benefits of each option open to them. But those models weren&#x2019;t able to explain a lot of real�life behavior: for example, the way we often make snap decisions based on little information; the fact that we sometimes change our minds, based on what others think; the way we occasionally do nice things for other people without any expectation of payback.<br><br>This spurred two psychologists�-Daniel Kahneman of Princeton and Amos Tversky of Stanford�-to cross enemy lines in 1979 and publish an article in Econometrica, an influential economics journal. In the article, they highlighted that people don&#x2019;t behave like machines when it comes to the choices they make.2 Emotional and social considerations drive many of our choices, often for good reason and in quite predictable ways. And with that, they sparked a revolution. Soon there was a new movement called &#x201c;behavioral economics&#x201d; that was devoted to apply�ing the powerful analytical tools of economics to the way that real people make decisions in the real world. The result? Well, Kahneman went on to win the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2002. But more important for us is that economists now have a much more nuanced and accurate understanding of the choices we make from day to day, and what it takes for us to nudge our behavior one way or another.<br>Neuroscience: More Sophisticated Measurement of Brain Activity<br><br>Finally, neuroscience has benefitted from dramatic advances in techniques for observing ordinary brains in action. Neuroscientists have long had access to a range of scanning techniques that helped reveal the structures and activities of the brain. Those scanning technologies often came at a cost of exposing the brain&#x2019;s owner to a good deal of radiation�-so they weren&#x2019;t ideal for non�medical research. Since the 1990s, though, steady improvements in less risky imaging technologies (including the discovery of functional MRI scanning) have made it easier for neuroscientists to watch what happens to healthy people&#x2019;s brains while normal things are happening to them. That means researchers can see which areas of the brain become active when a person is tickled by kindness or energized by accomplishment. They can observe the neural activity associated with someone feeling unhappy or stressed (for reasons beyond the fact that they&#x2019;re lying in a noisy metal tube or have electrodes strapped to their heads).<br><br>As a result, neuroscientists are gaining an increasingly refined understanding of the biological mechanisms behind our everyday thoughts, feelings, and actions. And that means they&#x2019;re exploring the kind of behavioral topics that also fascinate psychologists and economists�-for example, questions about the way we solve challenging problems and handle complex social interactions. In fact, many of the studies I cite in this book result from collaborations across the three behavioral science disciplines; it feels as if we&#x2019;re living in an era of &#x201c;neuro�psycho�economics.&#x201d; (Or something like that.) And this multi�disciplinary mash-up is great news for us. It means we get to benefit from complementary perspectives (biological, observational, and analytical) on topics that matter to us in the workplace�-which in turn results in richer guidance on ways for us to stay in top form.<br><br>So all in all, it&#x2019;s an excellent time to be thinking about the way that science can help us flourish.<br>Three Big Themes<br><br>Now, how do we apply all this evolving, exciting science to the everyday details of our working lives? That&#x2019;s where How to Have a Good Day comes in. This book is dedicated to translating the most valuable research into the context of today&#x2019;s working world�-the tough assignments, the packed schedules, the complex relationships�-to show you how to make every day reliably more enjoyable and productive.<br><br>Before we dive into the advice on creating the seven building blocks of a good day, I&#x2019;m going to highlight three important scientific themes that cut across the boundaries of the disciplines and recur throughout the book, to give you a foundation for the evidence and advice you&#x2019;ll find in each chapter. (If you&#x2019;d prefer to skip ahead to Part I of the book and get started on the practical applications, that&#x2019;s fine�-there&#x2019;s a glossary at the end of the book and you can always come back to this section later.) The three themes, in brief, are:<br><br>1. The two�system brain: The brain&#x2019;s activity is split across two complementary systems�-one deliberate and controlled, the other automatic and instinctive. The combination of the two makes us smart and productive. But we can make our cognitive resources go even further if we adjust the way we work to reflect each system&#x2019;s strengths and weaknesses.<br><br>2. The discover�defend axis: Subconsciously, we&#x2019;re constantly on the lookout for threats to defend against and rewards to discover. It takes very little to put our brains into defensive mode, and we&#x2019;re not at our smartest in that mode. However, a dose of self�awareness and the pursuit of certain types of rewards can help us move back into clearer�thinking discovery mode.<br><br>3. The mind�body loop: The state of our bodies and that of our minds are far more deeply entwined than we generally realize. As a result, certain simple physical interventions can immediately boost our intellectual performance, emotional resilience, and personal confidence.<br>Theme 1: The Two�System Brain<br><br>Our brains are impressive, by any measure. They keep our bodily functions humming while offering us immense storage capacity for complex memories and ideas. They&#x2019;re also capable of remarkable processing and calculating feats, giving us the ability to do things as diverse as mental arithmetic, guessing other people&#x2019;s motivations, keeping our cool in the face of provocation, and telling corny jokes. If brains were smartphones, they&#x2019;d be flying off the shelves.<br><br>To make all of this possible, our brains run two very different systems in parallel. Each has its own strengths, and it&#x2019;s the combination of the two that gives us so much intellectual horsepower. Psychologists had observed for many years that our minds seemed to have two quite different modes�-one more analytical, the other more instinctive.3 But it was Daniel Kahneman who brought the concept into the public spotlight when he accepted his Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002. He centered his acceptance speech on describing the distinction between &#x201c;effortless intuition&#x201d; and &#x201c;deliberate reasoning,&#x201d; concepts central to his bestselling book, Thinking Fast and Slow.4 Let&#x2019;s examine what he meant, and what that means for us in the workplace.<br>The Deliberate System<br><br>First, let&#x2019;s talk about the system we&#x2019;re more aware of, the one that controls the things we do consciously and carefully. Most of it sits in the part of the brain called the prefrontal cortex, and it goes by a lot of different names. In scientific circles, it&#x2019;s sometimes known as the &#x201c;controlled,&#x201d; &#x201c;explicit,&#x201d; or &#x201c;reflective&#x201d; system. Daniel Kahneman calls it the &#x201c;slow&#x201d; system, because it&#x2019;s indeed the slower of the two systems.5 I&#x2019;m going to refer to it as the deliberate system.<br><br>This deliberate system is broadly responsible for the sort of grown-up behavior that would surprise us in a toddler (or even a teenager): reasoning, self�control, and forward thinking.<br><br>By reasoning, I don&#x2019;t just mean logical thinking; I mean any effort to work out the best response to a situation that isn&#x2019;t routine. Whether we&#x2019;re fixing an error�laden document or figuring out how to help a stressed�out colleague, we&#x2019;re leaning on our deliberate system and asking it to do the following: review some information, connect that information to our past experience, make sense of it all, generate options, and evaluate those options wisely. Logic might be involved in that process, but so might empathy and creativity.<br><br>Self�control is also a broader concept than you might think. Most obviously, it&#x2019;s involved whenever we resist temptation�-for example, when we manage to bite our tongue rather than blurt out the foolish thing that we desperately want to say to our co�worker with the new haircut. But our deliberate system&#x2019;s self�control function is also central to something scientists call &#x201c;emotional regulation&#x201d;�-that is, not losing our cool when we&#x2019;re upset�-and to our ability to concentrate in the face of distractions.<br><br>Finally, our hardworking deliberate system is responsible for planning�-that is, setting goals and working out how to get there. That requires us to think abstractly: to imagine what the future looks like, to consider the various paths to get there, and to assess the eventual benefits of setting off on any of those paths. We run this sort of complex calculation every day, even when our goal is just to organize ourselves to get to a meeting on time.<br><br>In short, the deliberate system is responsible for putting us on our best behavior. When it&#x2019;s in full control, it makes us wise, self�possessed, and reliable. But let&#x2019;s be honest: we&#x2019;re not always like that. That&#x2019;s because our deliberate system has several limitations.<br>Smart�-but Small, Sequential, and Slow<br><br>First, it has limited capacity, because it relies heavily on something called working memory. Part notepad for incoming new data, part librarian for accessing stored experience, our working memory is the space where we hold information in our conscious mind as we figure out what to do with it. And our notepad only has so much space on it. For years it was thought we could hold about seven pieces of information in our minds at once, but more recent research suggests it&#x2019;s three or four at most.6<br><br>Those three or four chunks of information can be big or small. For example, suppose you have an elaborate new idea for a project. Your working memory is full of your thoughts on this new idea. But then the name of a colleague comes to mind�-someone you&#x2019;re supposed to call. Then, a message pops up on the screen in front of you. Maybe there&#x2019;s a blinking light on your phone. And all these things demand space in your working memory. Suddenly your deliberate system can&#x2019;t think as clearly about your new project idea, because some of your ideas have been moved off the notepad to make space for the name, the message, and the light. (What was that idea again?) So the size of our working memory places a limit on the deliberate system&#x2019;s ability to excel at all the reasoning, self�control, and planning activities I described above.<br>1. Milgram, S.

When a string of data--for example, a group of digits--is sufficiently closely connected in our memories that recalling one part of it draws forth the rest, it can count as one &#x201c;chunk.&#x201d; So the reason that we might remember a seven-digit phone number is because we&#x2019;ve turned it into two chunks of three and four digits, respectively&#x2014;or even, with repetition, one single chunk.

Wells&#x2019;s sobering, thought-provoking novel is one of the greatest works of science fiction ever created&#x2014;and as powerful today as when it was written. After inventing a machine that moves through time, the Traveler leaves Victorian London and goes far, far into the future. At first, the world he discovers seems peaceful and prosperous. But as he looks below the surface he realizes that things are not exactly as they first appeared.</p><p>&#34;Tom Teti does a more than credible job of animating the several characters who populate this classic.&#34;When the Time Traveller courageously stepped out of his machine for the first time, he found himself in the year 802,700--and everything has changed. In another, more utopian age, creatures seemed to dwell together in perfect harmony. The Time Traveller thought he could study these marvelous beings--unearth their secret and then retum to his own time--until he discovered that his invention, his only avenue of escape, had been stolen. H.G. Well&#39;s famous novel of one man&#39;s astonishing journey beyond the conventional limits of the imagination first appeared in 1895. It won him immediate recognition, and has been regarded ever since as one of the great masterpieces in the literature of science fiction.</p><h2>Priceless: The Myth of Fair Value (and How to Take Advantage of It)</h2><p><p>Prada stores carry a few obscenely expensive items in order to boost sales for everything else (which look like bargains in comparison). People used to download music for free, then Steve Jobs convinced them to pay. How? By charging 99 cents. That price has a hypnotic effect: the profit margin of the 99 Cents Only store is twice that of Wal-Mart. Why do text messages cost money, while e-mails are free? Why do jars of peanut butter keep getting smaller in order to keep the price the "same"? The answer is simple: prices are a collective hallucination.</p><p>In <i>Priceless</i>, the bestselling author William Poundstone reveals the hidden psychology of value. In psychological experiments, people are unable to estimate "fair" prices accurately and are strongly influenced by the unconscious, irrational, and politically incorrect. It hasn't taken long for marketers to apply these findings. "Price consultants" advise retailers on how to convince consumers to pay more for less, and negotiation coaches offer similar advice for businesspeople cutting deals. The new psychology of price dictates the design of price tags, menus, rebates, "sale" ads, cell phone plans, supermarket aisles, real estate offers, wage packages, tort demands, and corporate buyouts. Prices are the most pervasive hidden persuaders of all. Rooted in the emerging field of behavioral decision theory, <i>Priceless</i> should prove indispensable to anyone who negotiates.</p></p><p><p><b>William Poundstone</b> is the author of two previous Hill and Wang books: <i>Fortune's Formula</i> and <i>Gaming the Vote.</i></p><p>One</p><p>The $2.9 Million Cup of Coffee</p><p>In 1994 an Albuquerque jury awarded Stella Liebeck $2.9 million in damages after she spilled a piping-hot cup of McDonald&#x2019;s coffee on herself. This resulted in third-degree burns and precious little sympathy from the American public. Late-night comics and drive-time DJs turned Liebeck into a punch line. Talk radio pundits saw the lawsuit as Exhibit A to What&#x2019;s Wrong with Our Legal System. A Seinfeld episode had Kramer suing over spilled coffee, and a website inaugurated the "Stella Awards"&#x2014;booby prizes for the wackiest perversions of the justice system.</p><p>Liebeck&#x2019;s injuries were no joke. Her grandson had driven her to the McDonald&#x2019;s drive-through window. They bought the coffee, then pulled over and stopped the car so that Mrs. Liebeck could add cream and sugar. She steadied the cup between her legs as she pried off the lid. That&#x2019;s when it spilled. Liebeck racked up $11,000 in medical bills for skin grafts on her groin, buttocks, and thighs. The tricky question was, how do you put a price on Liebeck&#x2019;s suffering and McDonald&#x2019;s culpability?</p><p>Liebeck initially asked the fast-food chain for $20,000. McDonald&#x2019;s dismissed that figure and countered with a buzz-off offer of $800.</p><p>Liebeck&#x2019;s attorney, New Orleans&#x2013;born S. Reed Morgan, had ridden in this rodeo before. In 1986 he sued McDonald&#x2019;s on behalf of a Houston woman who also had third-degree burns from a coffee spill. In his most mesmerizing Deep South baritone, Morgan advanced the legally ingenious theory that McDonald&#x2019;s coffee was "defective" because it was too hot. McDonald&#x2019;s quality control people said the coffee should be served at 180 to 190 degrees Fahrenheit, and this was shown to be hotter than some other chains&#x2019; coffee. The Houston case was settled for $27,500.</p><p>Morgan monitored subsequent coffee lawsuits closely. He knew that in 1990 a California woman had suffered third-degree burns from McDonald&#x2019;s coffee and settled, with no great fanfare, for $230,000. There was one big difference. In the California case, it was a McDonald&#x2019;s employee who had spilled coffee on the woman.</p><p>Since Liebeck had spilled the coffee on herself, logic would say that her case was worth a lot less than $230,000. Morgan ignored that precedent and used a controversial psychological technique on the jury. I will describe that in a moment. For the time being, I will represent it with a row of dollar signs:</p><p>$ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $</p><p>The technique worked. As if hypnotized, the jury awarded Liebeck just under $2.9 million. That was $160,000 in compensatory damages plus $2.7 million in punitive damages. It took the jury four hours to decide. Reportedly, some jurors wanted to award as much as $9.6 million, and the others had to talk them down.</p><p>Judge Robert Scott apparently thought the jury award was as outlandish as almost everyone else in America did. He slashed the punitive damages to $480,000.</p><p>Even with the reduced award, an appeal from McDonald&#x2019;s was inevitable. The eighty-one-year-old Liebeck wasn&#x2019;t getting any younger. She soon settled with McDonald&#x2019;s for an undisclosed amount said to be less than $600,000. She must have recognized that she had hit a home run and wasn&#x2019;t likely to repeat it.</p><p>Skippy peanut butter recently redesigned its plastic jar. "The jar used to have a smooth bottom," explained Frank Luby, a price consultant with Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners in Cambridge, Massachusetts. "It now has an indentation, which takes a couple of ounces of peanut butter out of the product." The old jar contained 18 ounces; the new one has 16.3. The reason, of course, is so that Skippy can charge the same price.</p><p>That dimple at the bottom of the peanut butter jar has much to do with a new theory of pricing, one known in the psychology literature as coherent arbitrariness. This says that consumers really don&#x2019;t know what anything should cost. They walk the supermarket aisles in a half-conscious daze, judging prices from cues, helpful and otherwise. Coherent arbitrariness is above all a theory of relativity. Buyers are mainly sensitive to relative differences, not absolute prices. The new Skippy jar essentially amounts to a 10 percent increase in the price of peanut butter. Had they just raised the price 10 percent (to $3.39, say), shoppers would have noticed and some would have switched brands. According to the theory, the same shopper would be perfectly happy to pay $3.39 for Skippy, just as long as she doesn&#x2019;t know there&#x2019;s been an increase.</p><p>Luby holds a physics degree from the University of Chicago. In his job as price consultant, he more often thinks like a magician. Like a skillful conjurer, he is asked to manage what buyers notice and remember. Skippy peanut butter&#x2019;s customers often have small children and purchase it so regularly that they remember the last price they paid. For such products, consultants recommend creative ways of "invisibly" shrinking packages. In summer 2008 Kellogg&#x2019;s phased in thinner boxes of Cocoa Krispies, Froot Loops, Corn Pops, Apple Jacks, and Honey Smacks cereals. No one noticed. Shoppers just see the box&#x2019;s width and height on the shelf; by the time they reach for the box, the decision has been made and they&#x2019;re thinking of something else.</p><p>Dial and Zest recently changed the sculptural contours of their bars, shaving half an ounce off the weight. The boxes stayed about the same. Quilted Northern made its Ultra Plush toilet paper half an inch narrower. The makers of Puffs tissues shrank the length of their product from 8.6 to 8.4 inches. As the Puffs box remained the same (9.5 inches wide), there is presently over an inch of air hidden inside. You can&#x2019;t see it because the opening is in the middle. In any case, a shopper wouldn&#x2019;t notice the shrinkage unless she archived old Puffs tissues and measured them.</p><p>This ruse can go on only so long. Cereal boxes would collapse to cardboard envelopes; jars would become plastic voids. Eventually there arrives a point at which the manufacturer must make a bold move everyone will notice. It introduces a new, economy-size package. In size, shape, or other design features, the new package (and its price) is difficult to compare to the old. The consumer is flummoxed, unable to tell whether the new package is a good deal or not. So she tosses it into the cart. The cycle of shrinking packages repeats, ad infinitum.</p><p>If you find this a silly charade, you&#x2019;re not alone. Just about everyone does, when they think about it. Many grumble they&#x2019;d rather pay an inflation-adjusted price for the quantities they&#x2019;ve known. Others swear they look at the market&#x2019;s comparison labels, giving price per ounce, and wouldn&#x2019;t be fooled. One of the things that price consultants have learned is that what consumers say and what they do are not the same thing. For the most part, memories of prices are short, and memories of boxes and packages shorter.</p><p>It wasn&#x2019;t so long ago that companies priced their products with no strategy beyond the demand curves of Economics 101. In the past generation, firms such as Boston Consulting, Roland Berger, Revionics, and Atenga have prospered by advising businesses on the surprisingly complex psychology of price. No firm has spearheaded the professionalization of pricing more than Simon-Kucher &amp; Partners (SKP). German business professor Hermann Simon and two of his doctoral students founded the firm in Bonn in 1985. SKP is now nearing five hundred employees stationed all over the globe, with U.S. offices in Cambridge, New York, and San Francisco. With sixty Ph.D.s on staff, quite a few in physics, SKP has a reputation as the rocket scientists of pricing. The firm exudes a Star Trek cosmopolitanism. Employees from India, Korea, Germany, Switzerland, and Spain mingle in the Cambridge office, and it&#x2019;s the practice to rotate promising consultants among nations. Each year SKP assembles its far-flung employees for a party at a castle on the Rhine.</p><p>The influence of SKP on the prices we pay for just about everything is as little recognized as it is staggering. Rules that apply to other types of consultancies don&#x2019;t apply to pricing. An ad agency would not have Coca-Cola and Pepsi as clients&#x2014;but SKP does. In many industries, SKP advises half a dozen of the leading firms. Its current roster of clients includes Procter &amp; Gamble, Nestl�, Microsoft, Intel, Texas Instruments, T-Mobile, Vodaphone, Nokia, Sony Ericsson, Honeywell, Thyssen-Krupp, Warner Music, Bertelsmann, Merck, Bayer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, UBS, Barclays, HSBC, Goldman Sachs, Dow Jones, Hilton, British Airways, Lufthansa, Emirates Airlines, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Toyota, General Motors, Volvo, Caterpillar, Adidas, and the Toronto Blue Jays. The same psychological tricks apply whether you&#x2019;re setting a price for text messages or toilet paper or airline tickets. To SKP&#x2019;s consultants, prices are the most pervasive of hidden persuaders.</p><p>Though a price is just a number, it can evoke a complex set of emotions&#x2014;something now visible in brain scans. Depending on the context, the same price may be perceived as a bargain or a rip-off; or it may not matter at all. A few of the tricks are timeless, like shrinking packages and prices ending in the magic number 9. But price consultancy is more than the latest chapter in flat-world hucksterism. It draws on some of the most important and innovative recent work in psychology. In the mundane act of naming a price, we translate the desires of our hearts into the public language of numbers. That turns out to be a surprisingly tricky process.</p><p></p><p>Excerpted from Priceless by William Poundstone.<br>Copyright 2010 by William Poundstone.<br>Published in 2010 by Hill and Wang.<br>All rights reserved.

Some writers start at the beginning and let the story unfold without a plan. They are called "pantsers," because they write by the "seat of the pants."</p><p>Other writers plan and outline and know the ending before they start. These are the "plotters."</p><p>The two sides never seem to agree with each other on the best approach.</p><p>But what if it's not the beginning or the end that is the key to a successful book? What if, amazing as it may seem, the place to begin writing your novel is in the very middle of the story?</p><p>According to #1 bestselling writing teacher James Scott Bell, that's exactly where you'll find your story's heart and heat. Bell's "Mirror Moment" is the secret, and its power is available to any writer, at any stage of the writing process.</p><p>Bringing together years of craft study and personal discovery, Bell presents a truly unique approach to writing a novel, one that will stand the test of time and serve you all your writing life.</p><p>"I need three things before I tackle a new novel: Diet Coke, a laptop, and my dog-eared copies of James Scott Bell's books on writing craft!&#x201d; - <b>Kami Garcia</b>, #1 NYT Times &amp; International Bestselling author</p></p><p>I've been studying plot and structure for over twenty-five years. Plot was something I did not understand when I started out. I thought writers just sat down at the typewriter (you can read about the typewriter on Wikipedia!) and an intricate story just flowed out of their fingertips. I'd been told you can't learn to write fiction. You either had this inherent talent or you didn't.<br>&nbsp; I believed that for years.<br>&nbsp; But then one day I decided I would try to learn even if I failed. I had to try. I wanted to write that much. And slowly, through immersion in the craft and daily practice, I started to get it. Then I got published and started to teach it. I love this craft of ours, and love helping other writers.<br>&nbsp; I've written maybe fifty novels (not all of them published!) and I've written them in different ways. I've "pantsed' my way to completed book (no outline or planning) and I've outlined others. I've done it in between, too. So I know full well the strengths and weaknesses of every approach.<br>&nbsp; I've also been amused by some of the vehement arguments by proponents of a particular method.<br>&nbsp; But now, finally, I have come up with&nbsp; way that will bring calm and singing to this whole discussion. I do hope I'm on the short list for the Nobel Peace Prize next year.<br>&nbsp; What is this novel approach? (Pun intended). Well, it's a method. In this method you don't start at the beginning and pants your way through. Nor do you start with the ending and outline the whole doggone thing.<br>&nbsp; You actually start from the middle.James Scott Bell is a bestselling thriller author and writing coach.

GOODSTEIN)</p><h2>Hands-On Agronomy, 3rd Edition</h2><p>The soil is much more than just a substrate that anchors crops in place. An ecologically balanced soil system is essential for maintaining nutritious, resilient crops. In Hands-On Agronomy, Neal Kinsey shows us how working with the soil to bring it into balance produces healthier crops with a higher yield. Meticulously revised and expanded, this new edition includes additional chapters and updated information to further enhance Kinsey's sophisticated, easy-to-live-with system of fertility management that focuses on balance, not merely quantity of fertility elements.<p> Hands-On Agronomy covers the major fertility elements, stressing that accurate soil analyses and audits are key for quality crop production. Discover why simple N-P-K fertilization is not enough to sustain and nurture your soil to optimal health. With Kinsey's help, understand the proper use, timing and application of manures, compost, tillage and micronutrients. Kinsey demonstrates how to recognize and remedy common problems and examines the importance of balancing soil nutrients for maximum yield. In addition, the "whats and whys" of nutrients, soil drainage, tilth, soil structure and organic matter are explained in detail. In this truly comprehensive manual on soil management, Kinsey has drawn on his experience with thousands of students to clarify and expand on the lessons taught therein, making Hands-On Agronomy more accessible -- and informative -- than ever.</p></p><p></p><h2>The New American Ephemeris for the 21st Century 2000-2100 at Midnight, Michelsen Memorial Edition</h2><p>In 1976, Neil F. Michelsen compiled, programmed and published the first edition of the ephemeris series that set new standards of accuracy for contemporary astrology. In 2006, celebrating the 30th anniversary of that first publication, Rique Pottenger continues the work that Michelsen began with this new full 21st century ephemeris, updated with the very latest data. New features include Ceres added to daily longitude listings of Sun through Pluto. Monthly listings for Eris, Pallas, Juno and Vesta, along with Chiron and a new and improved position for the Galactic center. Improvements enable finding double ingresses on a single day, astro data phenomena sorted by time as well as date, and more. &#34;Remembering Neil&#34; text section capsulizes the beginning years of the development of computer technology for astrologers and Neil&#39;s contribution. Read excerpts from Neil&#39;s own writings and commentary from colleagues. Study Neil&#39;s chart.</p><p>Rique Pottenger, who has a B.Sc. in Math and Astronomy from University of Arizona, and an M.S. in Computer Science from UCLA, was employed at Astro Computing Services and ACS Publications from 1984-2004. After Michelsen&#39;s passing in 1990, Pottenger assumed responsibility for updating the Michelsen references and maintaining and improving ACS&#39; production programs. the task of revising and updating the ACS reference works after Michelsen&#39;s passing in 1990. He also programmed The Asteroid Ephemeris 1900-2050 with Chiron and the Black Moon, and the Electronic Astrologer software series. Now semi-retired, he lives in Opelika, Alabama, where he continues to do astrological programming for a small list of clients....newly updated and expanded with the latest Jet Propulsion Laboratory data, several other new features, while retaining familiar data and a format relied upon by astrologers worldwide. Updates and additions include the entire 21st Century from 2000-2100; Ceres added to daily longitude listings, a new formula increasing accuracy of monthly position calculations of the Galactic Center; monthly positions for Eris, Chiron, Pallas, Juno and Vesta; Astro Data column phenomena sorted by time as well as by data; and planetary ingress data that includes R if planet is retrograde when it ingresses. Of special note is the Dedication followed by memorial feature "Remembering Neil" which capsulizes the beginning years of the development of computer technology as applied to astrology. The New American Ephemeris for the 21st Century is a 624-page treasury of information, example and instruction that is especially recommended to dedicated astrologers and should prove to be a cornerstone of any personal, professional and academic library's Astrological Studies reference collection. --Small Press Bookwatch, Dec. 1, 2006<br><br>...a very nice introduction telling you about Neil Michelsen and his place in astrology, as well as a complete explanation of the technical basis of all the information in the ephemeris. It's nice to see this wonderful new edition of a classic. It is as beautiful and as comprehensive as ever, and worth every penny of the very reasonable price. --Kenneth Irving, Horoscope Guide, June 2007<br><br>Anyone who wants to study or practice astrology needs to know exactly where the planets are at any particular time. This requires either some good astrology software or an accurate ephemeris...Personally, I need both...and this one is going with me whenever I do astrology readings. The few pages introducting The New American Ephemeris begin with a tribute to Neil Michelsen, who created the first inexpensive, accurate ephemeris. The earlier version from 1976 was a bit like the Guttenburg Bible in that it allowed...quick and easy access to precise planetary positions without having to rely on the high priests of the astronomical community. Based on information from the U.S. Almanac Office and his own incipient knowledge of celestial mechanics, Michelsen developed the software routines that spit out the planet's positions...used a teletype machine connected to an IBM 1130 computer that received commands from keypunch cards....Computers have come a long way since then...Rique Pottenger took over when Michelsen died in 1990...Among the most interesting--and last minute changes...(due to) International Astronomers Union...Pluto still holds its rightful place on the top line with the other planets. Now, Ceres is listed between Mars and Jupiter...Eris (UB313) is listed in a box in the lower right hand corner, along with Chiron and the Galactic center...monthly positions...(with) the three asteroids--Vesta, Pallas and Juno--are also listed...Altogether, The New American Ephemeris for the 21st Century must be considered one of the modern astrologer's indispensable tools. --Chris Lorenz, Dell Horoscope, May 2007</p><h2>The Sicily Cookbook: Authentic Recipes from a Mediterranean Island</h2><p><b><b>Embark on the enchanting culinary journey and experience the culinary delights of the Sicilian diet.</b></b><br><br>Join Sicilian cook, writer, and photographer Cettina Vicenzino as she shares more than 70 authentic and mouth-watering recipes from this unique Mediterranean island.

But it is also fascinating and incredibly informative. The book's sections are not only beautiful, intelligent, sometimes humorous and always sexy as hell. They are also important, for what the artists have to say in the accompanying texts and essays about themselves and about the art they make. This is a wonderful collection that every reader and writer should read. It's a knockout on so many different levels!&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Samuel R. Delany, <em>(author of Bread &amp; Wine, Hogg, and Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders)</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;<em>Massive</em> is amazing. Bigger and bolder than Tom of Finland, this manga porn transcends any genre, and stakes its claim on unbridled and unapologetic masculinity.

The collected work in <em>Massive</em> showcases a selection of Japan&#x2019;s best gay erotic artists, some of it rarely seen in the West outside of poorly translated scans...&#x201d;<br> - <strong>C. Edwards, <em>Out</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Replete with rippling muscles and hypermasculinity, this volume provides a fascinating overview of contemporary gay manga and its creators. In a medium dominated by visual exaggeration, the figures given vivid, lusty life by these artists express the apex of a powerful butch sensibility. While the work... is as explicit as it could possibly get, there is a clearly expressed joy to its aggressive sexuality... U.S. collectors of this material will be thirsty for this first-ever English language anthology, and adventurous comics readers will encounter a realm they might have otherwise overlooked.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;...[H]andsomely designed, meticulously researched... <em>Massive</em>... is far more than just a collection of pornographic stories ... [W]hat makes this such an invaluable anthology is right there in the title: the focus on 'the men who make it.' ... So how&#x2019;s the sex? It&#x2019;s hot, strange, scary, awkward, intense, violent, and even hilarious at times. ... Just like any other great pieces of art, these stories are outlets for unbridled creative expression, and that personal connection delivers some incredibly passionate pornography.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Oliver Sava, <em>The A.V.

Amazed, he samples it, shares it at work and, buoyed by his friendly reception, sympathetically helps several people out on the way home (e.g., he watches the newspaper stall so that its proprietor can take his cold to the doctor). He's soon baking brownies, hosting a neighborhood picnic, and reading to the local kids. Then the postman arrives with the news that the candy was delivered to the wrong address, putting poor Mr. Hatch into a funk; but his devoted new friends rally round to bring him back into their cheerful society. Told with warmth and a light touch, the story easily transcends its predictability. It's much enhanced by Yalowitz's mellow color- pencil illustrations. His unique elongated characters with their extra-tall heads are at once animated and serene; the smooth clarity of his scenes is enlivened with many amusing details. A charming book with a real plot, its amiable tone beautifully complemented by the intriguing illustrations. (Picture book. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

As the writer/historian you spend days if not weeks with each individual, researching their stories, getting under their skin. You really have the feeling that you are doing a kind of cosmic CPR,taking their original words and breathing new life in a readable format that places readers at the kitchen table with that person who had something important to say. The reader shares the intimate moments with them as he/she gets absorbed in a real story being told. As an interviewer it happened many times to me directly with our World War II veterans, in living rooms, kitchens and dining rooms all over 'Hometown USA', in the classroom, and at reunion'hospitality rooms' and hotel breakfast tables across America.&nbsp;<br><b>But memories are short.&nbsp;</b>A World War II memoirist once wrote, 'Ignorance and apathy are the greatest dangers to freedom.' I agree, but as a lifelong history teacher, I contend that it begins with people simply not being exposed to the history to begin with. For how could one not be drawn into these stories, the human drama, the interaction and the emotion that goes into putting an ideal first? After sitting at their table, how could you not give weight to what they have seen, and where they think we are going, as a people, as a nation?&nbsp;I saw this spark kindled time and again in my classroom, when we got to hear from real people who had a front row seat, who acted in the greatest drama in the history of the world.&nbsp;<br>Perhaps now I ramble. Now it is better to have them tell you themselves, about the world they grew up in, the challenges and obstacles placed on life's course, and how a generation of Americans not only rose to the challenge, but built the country and the freedoms that we enjoy today. They truly saved the world. Be inspired. Share their stories; give them voice. Lest we forget.MATTHEW ROZELL is an award-winning history teacher, author, blogger and speaker.

That's because ageing is not a disease &#x2013; it is inevitable.<br>But what if everything you think you know about ageing is wrong?<br>What if ageing is a disease? And that disease is curable.<br>In THE EVOLUTION OF AGEING, Dr. David Sinclair, one of the world&#x2019;s foremost authorities on genetics and ageing, argues just that. He has dedicated his life&#x2019;s work to chasing more than a longer lifespan &#x2013; he wants to enable people to live longer, healthier, and disease-free well into our hundreds. In this book, he reveals a bold new theory of ageing, one that pinpoints a root cause of ageing that lies in an ancient genetic survival circuit. This genetic trick &#x2013; a circuit designed to halt reproduction in order to repair damage to the genome &#x2013;has enabled earth&#x2019;s early microcosms to survive and evolve into more advanced organisms. But this same survival circuit is the reason we age: as genetic damage accumulates over our lifespans from UV rays, environmental toxins, and unhealthy diets, our genome is overwhelmed, causing gray hair, wrinkles, achy joints, heart issues, dementia, and, ultimately, death.<br>But genes aren&#x2019;t our destiny; we have more control over them than we&#x2019;ve been taught to believe. We can&#x2019;t change our DNA, but we can harness the power of the epigenome to realise the true potential of our genes. Drawing on his cutting-edge findings at the forefront of medical research, Dr. Sinclair will provide a scientifically-proven roadmap to reverse the genetic clock by activating our vitality genes, so we can live younger longer. Readers will discover how a few simple lifestyle changes &#x2013; like intermittent fasting, avoiding too much animal protein, limiting sugar, avoiding x-rays, exercising with the right intensity, and even trying cold therapy &#x2013; can activate our vitality genes. Dr. Sinclair ends the book with a look to the near future, exploring what the world might look like &#x2013; and what will need to change &#x2013; when we are all living well to 120 or more.<br>Dr. Sinclair takes what we have long accepted as the limits of human potential and mortality and turns them into choices. THE EVOLUTION OF AGEING is destined to be the biggest book on genes, biology, and longevity of this decade.</p></p><p></p><h2>Made by Maxine</h2><p><b>Meet Maxine, an inspiring young maker who knows that with enough effort and imagination (and mistakes), it's possible to invent anything.</b><br><br>Maxine loves making new things from old things.

They aren&#x2019;t looking for a job. They are following a call. God is setting them apart to pastoral service. Are you one of those men? Dave Harvey&#x2019;s wise book will help you answer that question.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Raymond C. Ortlund Jr.</strong>,&nbsp;Pastor to&nbsp;Pastors, Immanuel Church, Nashville, Tennessee</p><p>&#x201c;Discerning God&#x2019;s call with clarity is an ongoing challenge, but a necessary journey. Dave Harvey has written one of the most helpful, practical books on Christian calling that I&#x2019;ve read. <em>Am I Called?</em> guides a wide range of readers, not just pastors, through God&#x2019;s call to ministry in their lives. I know I will be sharing <em>Am I Called?</em> with many in the years to come.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Ed Stetzer,</strong>&nbsp;Billy Graham Distinguished Chair of&nbsp;Church, Mission, and Evangelism, Wheaton College</p><p>&#x201c;As a young man, I wrestled with the issue Dave Harvey wisely and skillfully addresses in this book. I&#x2019;m glad a generation of young men can find in these pages the help that I was looking for thirty years ago.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Bob Lepine,</strong> Cohost, <em>FamilyLife Today</em>; Pastor, Redeemer Community Church, Little Rock, Arkansas</p><p>&#x201c;The issue of the call to pastoral ministry is a complicated one, involving matters of character, technical ability, and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. In this book, Dave Harvey offers a good overview of the things that anyone contemplating the ministry needs to consider. In an accessible, conversational style, Dave guides the reader through the biblical teaching on this matter&#x2015;carefully balancing the external and the internal aspects of the call. He also provides apposite anecdotes from church history to illustrate his points. Full of wisdom and wit, <em>Am I Called?</em> is a delightful and challenging book for potential ministers, their wives, and, indeed, those already in the ministry to read. Highly commended.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Carl R. Trueman,</strong> Professor of Biblical and Religious Studies, Grove City College</p><p>&#x201c;The history of the church is marked and marred by the &#x2018;ministries&#x2019; of unqualified men. The reason I am glad to recommend <em>Am I Called?</em> is that Dave Harvey sets the call to pastoral ministry in the biblical context: the calling from God and the calling from and to a local church. May God use this book to raise up a whole new generation of men who are called, equipped, and competent for the work he (and we) have called them to.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Tim Challies,</strong> blogger, Challies.com</p><p>&#x201c;My appreciation for this book is matched only by a sense of frustration that it wasn&#x2019;t around when I was considering my call to pastoral ministry. Dave Harvey manages to explain and insist upon the biblical qualifications for pastors without being discouraging or legalistic. Most importantly, the good news about Jesus is the heartbeat of this clear and engaging book. If you are considering entering into pastoral ministry, <em>Am I Called?</em> will act as a faithful mirror and friend. If you are already a pastor, it will renew your passion for raising up the next generation of ministers.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mike McKinley,</strong> Pastor, Sterling Park Baptist Church; author, <em>Church in Hard Places</em>; <em>Am I Really a Christian?</em>; and <em>Church Planting Is for Wimps</em></p><p>&#x201c;According to the Apostle Paul, faithful gospel ministry must include entrusting that ministry to others who will carry it on. <em>Am I Called?</em> will be of immense help to both those wondering whether they are called into gospel ministry, and to the pastors in position to help them figure that out. I know of no other book that does the important, practical work this book gets done and does so well. <em>Am I Called?</em> is marked by both wise, practical insight and a strong gospel vibrancy. I will be putting this book to regular use with young men at my church, and I&#x2019;m glad to be able to highly recommend it.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Mike Bullmore</strong>, Senior Pastor, CrossWay Community Church, Bristol, Wisconsin</p></p><h2>Gayma Sutra: The Complete Guide</h2><p>In, over and out?

Mitchell argues that romance doesn't actually diminish in long-term relationships&#x2015;it becomes increasingly dangerous. What we regard as the transience of love is really risk management. Mitchell shows that love can endure, if only we become aware of our self-destructive efforts to protect ourselves from its risks. "Those who read this book will love more wisely because of it."&#x2015;Andrew Solomon, author of <em>The Noonday Demon</em> "[A] work on romance that is rich and multi-layered."&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em> "Cheerful, open, and humane&#x2015;you'd definitely have wanted him as your analyst."&#x2015;Judith Shulevitz, <em>The New York Times</em> Book Review "[T]houghtful, compassionate, and profoundly optimistic."&#x2015;JoAnn Gutin, Salon.com</p><p>To delve into the subject of love with relational psychologist Stephen A. Mitchell is to race headfirst into an enormous haystack with a kid who's intent on finding not one, but probably a dozen, needles. In <i>Can Love Last?</i> Mitchell's boyish curiosity and profound intelligence virtually set fire to the subject, both enlightening and challenging his readers. Mitchell's premise is that romance, in its many forms, is key to a life worth living. <p> Why, then, does the sizzle so often fizzle, especially in committed relationships? More importantly, what forces compel humans to actively douse romantic flames in favor of more "stable" love? Mitchell's probings of these and other questions take him on a fascinating journey through times and topics historical as well as contemporary. From Plato to Freud, Homer to Kris Kristofferson, Mitchell weaves history, philosophy, literature, and (of course) psychology into a surprisingly sensible pattern. Yes, a few loud threads stand out, including his well-supported theory that "stable" love is actually much riskier than romance. But over all, differing theories on love and desire, stability and adventure, or surrender and control find more parallels than crossroads under Mitchell's tender care, making this book an intellectual gift to the masses. <i>--Liane Thomas</i></p>Stephen A.

Most&nbsp;believe that the patriots defeated the British, as though in a football&nbsp;game, and then Americans lived happily ever after in blissful&nbsp;democracy.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nothing could be further from the truth.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the war ended in 1783, the United States was governed&nbsp;by the Articles of Confederation. This fairly flimsy compact provided&nbsp;for a one-house&nbsp;Congress, one vote per state, and very little<br> else. True, this Congress had a president, but he didn&#x2019;t derive his&nbsp;power from the people, and he was an intentionally weak figurehead.&nbsp;After all, the last thing the founding fathers wanted was&nbsp;another king.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within two years, the fledgling United States was on the verge&nbsp;of political collapse. The federal government had no power to tax&nbsp;people, goods, properties, or businesses. That may sound wonderful&nbsp;until you stop to consider all the consequences: The federal&nbsp;government had no revenue and issued no currency. There was no&nbsp;money for raising troops, building ships, or engaging in other&nbsp;activities vital to a nation&#x2019;s self-defense.&nbsp;The country was vulnerable&nbsp;to attack and domination by a host of foreign powers. At sea,&nbsp;American vessels were pirated by foreign ships; their cargo and&nbsp;passengers were frequently held for ransom. On land, British and&nbsp;Spanish factions were arming Native Americans and encouraging&nbsp;them to raid American settlements on the edges of the frontier.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;States took matters into their own hands. Nine states had their&nbsp;own naval forces and pursued their own foreign policies. They&nbsp;imposed taxes on goods from other states as though they were dealing&nbsp;with foreign countries. There were no courts to decide&nbsp;disagreements between states. Private banks were issuing their own&nbsp;currency, but their notes were often distrusted and viewed as IOUs&nbsp;that might never be repaid. Doing business with other states was&nbsp;challenging if not impossible. Seesawing cycles of inflation and&nbsp;deflation were destroying lives. Foreclosures skyrocketed, and banks&nbsp;began seizing the homes of poor farmers with unpaid mortgages.&nbsp;Many wealthy landowners feared a bloody class revolution&#x2014;or&nbsp;an&nbsp;all-out&nbsp;civil war.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clearly something had to be done or the nation wouldn&#x2019;t live&nbsp;long enough to celebrate its eleventh birthday. Alexander Hamilton,&nbsp;James Madison, and a host of other bigwigs proposed a &#x201c;grand&nbsp;convention&#x201d; at which delegates would gather to revise, debate, and&nbsp;expand the Articles of Confederation. Seventy-four&nbsp;delegates were&nbsp;chosen by their respective states; only fifty-five&nbsp;answered the call,&nbsp;and many of those with skepticism. Patrick Henry, the famed Virginia&nbsp;rebel, refused to attend, complaining that he &#x201c;smelt a rat.&#x201d;&nbsp;Rhode Island sent no representatives at all.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In May of 1787, the willing participants journeyed to the very&nbsp;same Philadelphia building where the Declaration of Independence&nbsp;had been signed. True, these men had once banded together&nbsp;to fight as brothers against a common enemy, but now they were&nbsp;deeply distrustful of one another. Small states were suspicious of&nbsp;large states. The nation was divided over slavery. Every delegate&nbsp;arrived wanting something&#x2014;but few were willing to sacrifice anything.&nbsp;In such a contentious environment, reaching compromise&nbsp;would be tough. More than a dozen delegates quit and went home&nbsp;before the convention&#x2019;s end.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thirty-nine&nbsp;who remained and signed the U.S. Constitution&nbsp;are the focus of this book. <i>Signing Their Rights Away</i> introduces&nbsp;you to the remarkable historical figures who jettisoned the limp&nbsp;and lifeless Articles of Confederation for a robust and rigorous&nbsp;document that provided the framework for an enduring system of&nbsp;government (at more than 230 years old, the U.S. Constitution is&nbsp;the oldest functioning constitution in the world).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, these men prioritized the welfare of their country&nbsp;over politics or personal advancement. They fought with great&nbsp;conviction&#x2014;but they eventually came to understand that no single&nbsp;delegate could walk away with all the marbles. They agreed to&nbsp;compromise for the greater good. Yet, today, despite their heroic&nbsp;labors, most of them have lapsed into obscurity.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They deserve better&#x2014;if only because their stories are so interesting.&nbsp;At least twenty-two<br> of the signers served in the military&#x2014;as&nbsp;soldiers, chaplains, administrative officers&#x2014;during the Revolutionary&nbsp;War. Five were captured and imprisoned by the British.&nbsp;Many lost homes, property, and loved ones to the war. Two died&nbsp;in duels; one attempted suicide.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most were educated, cosmopolitan gentlemen accustomed to a&nbsp;life of wealth and privilege. Eighteen of the signers were trained in&nbsp;law; the remainder were merchants, plantation owners, and&nbsp;financiers. They represented the views, expectations, and entitlements&nbsp;of the nation&#x2019;s elite. Such men had no problem ignoring the&nbsp;rights of women and slaves when designing their compact for government.&nbsp;Nor were they champions of free white men with meager&nbsp;property. (One signer sought to restrict government service to men&nbsp;with a net worth exceeding $100,000!) Having witnessed intimidation&nbsp;and mob violence at the hands of enemies and patriots&nbsp;alike, many of the signers didn&#x2019;t trust the American public. The&nbsp;idea of granting power to<i> all</i> individuals was a fairly radical idea.&nbsp;During debates, many signers repeatedly derided the notion that&nbsp;Josiah Q. Public could serve wisely in the House and Senate, or,&nbsp;heaven help us, the presidency.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But in the end, enough members knew that this attitude did&nbsp;not reflect the principles of the revolution they had just fought.&nbsp;They were gutsy enough to give the &#x201c;little guy&#x201d; a shot at power.&nbsp;Anyone could be president, anyone could be senator&#x2014;even you.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So the next time September 17 rolls around, eat a hot dog,&nbsp;watch some fireworks, and celebrate Constitution Day&#x2014;that fateful&nbsp;date in 1787 when thirty-nine&nbsp;sweaty men dressed in stockings&nbsp;signed their names to the United States Constitution. Remember&nbsp;how they argued, hoped, feared, persevered, and, most important,&nbsp;compromised to create a lasting document that still governs today.&nbsp;July 4 may be remembered as the day the United States was born,&nbsp;but September 17 marks the country&#x2019;s passage into adulthood,&nbsp;laying the groundwork for two centuries of remarkable expansion&nbsp;and spectacular achievements.</p><h2>The Red Rooster Cookbook: The Story of Food and Hustle in Harlem</h2><p><b>Southern comfort food and multicultural recipes from the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling superstar chef Marcus Samuelsson&#x2019;s iconic Harlem restaurant.</b><br><br> When the James Beard Award-winning chef Marcus Samuelsson opened Red Rooster on Malcolm X Boulevard in Harlem, he envisioned more than a restaurant. It would be the heart of his neighborhood and a meet-and-greet for both the downtown and the uptown sets, serving Southern black and cross-cultural food. It would reflect Harlem's history. Ever since the 1930s, Harlem has been a magnet for more than a million African Americans, a melting pot for Spanish, African, and Caribbean immigrants, and a mecca for artists.<br><br>These traditions converge on Rooster&#x2019;s menu, with Brown Butter Biscuits, Chicken and Waffle, Killer Collards, and Donuts with Sweet Potato Cream. They&#x2019;re joined by global-influenced dishes such as Jerk Bacon and Baked Beans, Latino Pork and Plantains, and Chinese Steamed Bass and Fiery Noodles. Samuelsson&#x2019;s Swedish-Ethiopian background shows in Ethiopian Spice-Crusted Lamb, Slow-Baked Blueberry Bread with Spiced Maple Syrup, and the Green Viking, sprightly Apple Sorbet with Caramel Sauce.<br><br>Interspersed with lyrical essays that convey the flavor of the place and stunning archival and contemporary photos, <i>The Red Rooster Cookbook</i> is as layered as its inheritance.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>MARCUS SAMUELSSON owns Red Rooster Harlem, Ginny's Supper Club, and Street Bird.

To a list including the Studio Museum and the Schomburg Center, one must add the Red Rooster, which has rapidly become the gathering place for the cultural glitterati, where conversation and music are nourished by Marcus&#x2019;s sublime cuisine.

White</i></p><h2>Complete Poems and Selected Letters of John Keats (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>'I think I shall be among the English Poets after my death,' John Keats soberly prophesied in 1818 as he started writing the blankverse epic <i>Hyperion.</i> Today he endures as the archetypal Romantic genius who explored the limits of the imagination and celebrated the pleasures of the senses but suffered a tragic early death. Edmund Wilson counted him as 'one of the half dozen greatest English writers,' and T. S. Eliot has paid tribute to the Shakespearean quality of Keats's greatness. Indeed, his work has survived better than that of any of his contemporaries the devaluation of Romantic poetry that began early in this century. This Modern Library edition contains all of Keats's magnificent verse: 'Lamia,' 'Isabella,' and 'The Eve of St. Agnes'; his sonnets and odes; the allegorical romance <i>Endymion;</i> and the five-act poetic tragedy <i>Otho the Great.</i> Presented as well are the famous posthumous and fugitive poems, including the fragmentary 'The Eve of Saint Mark' and the great 'La Belle Dame sans Merci,' perhaps the most distinguished literary ballad in the language. 'No one else in English poetry, save Shakespeare, has in expression quite the fascinating felicity of Keats, his perception of loveliness,' said Matthew Arnold. 'In the faculty of naturalistic interpretation, in what we call natural magic, he ranks with Shakespeare.'</p><p>John Keats was born in London in living quarters connected with his maternal grandfather's livery stable, the Swan and Hoop Inn, on October 31, 1795. He was the eldest of five children (one of whom died in infancy) begot by Thomas and Frances Jennings Keats. His father was the chief hostler at the Swan and Hoop, and the family prospered. The boy was eight years old when Thomas Keats was killed in a riding accident; the next year, in 1805, Keats's grandfather died. When the future poet was fourteen, his mother (after an unsuccessful remarriage) succumbed to tuberculosis. By then, however, Keats had received a liberal education at the progressive Clarke school, a private academy in the village of Enfield, twelve miles north of London, where for eight years he studied English literature, modern languages, and Latin. (He began translating Virgil's Aeneid while still at shcool.) Charles Cowden Clarke, the headmaster's son, remembered him as an outgoing youth who made friends easily and fought passionately in their defense. A fellow student recalled his pugnacious spirit: 'Keats was not in childhood attached to books. His penchant was for fighting. He would fight any one.' Yet George Keats spoke of his brother's 'nervous, morbid temperament' (perhaps attributable to a complex about being short&#x2014;'poor little Johnny Keats' was barely five feet tall) and of his having 'many a bitter fit of hypochondriasm.' Indeed Keats himself wrote: 'My mind has been the most discontented and restless one that ever was put into a body too small for it.'<br><br>In 1811 Keats left the Clarke school to become a surgeon's apprentice&#x2014;first at Thomas Hammond's apothecary shop in a small town near Enfield and later in London at Guy's Hospital. (Surgery would have been a respectable and reasonable calling for someone of Keats's means: unlike the profession of medicine, it did not require a university degree. Moreover, Keats always maintained he was 'ambitious of doing the world some good.') During his five years of study for a license, the young apprentice completed his translation of the Aeneid and 'devoured rather than read' Ovid's <i>Metamorphoses,</i> Milton's <i>Paradise Lost,</i> and other books he borrowed from the Clarke school. But the work that decisively awakened his love of poetry&#x2014;indeed shocked him suddenly into self-awareness of his own powers of imagination&#x2014;was Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene. At some point in 1814 Keats composed his first poem, 'In Imitation of Spenser.' Although he struck medical colleagues as an 'idle loafing fellow, always writing poetry,' Keats passed the apothecaries' examination that allowed him to practice surgery on July 25, 1816. <br><br>In the meantime, his poetic genius was being recognized and encouraged by early friends like Charles Cowden Clarke and J. H. Reynolds, and in October 1816 Clarke introduced him to Leigh Hunt, whose Examiner, the leading liberal magazine of the day, had recently published Keats's sonnet 'O Solitude.' Five months later, on March 3, 1817, <i>Poems,</i> his first volume of verse, appeared. Despite the high hopes of the Hunt circle, it was a failure. During the fall of that year, Keats stayed with Oxford student Benjamin Bailey at Magdalen College. While Bailey crammed for exams, Keats worked on <i>Endymion,</i> his four-thousand-line romantic allegory; the two read and discussed Wordsworth, Hazlitt, Milton, Dante, and Shakespeare. Back in London, on November 22, 1817, Keats wrote to Bailey the first of his famous letters to friends (and siblings) on aesthetics, the social role of poetry, and his own sense of poetic mission. Rarely has a poet left such a remarkable record of his thoughts on his own career and its relation to the history of poetry. (The letters also reveal the astonishing speed with which Keats matured as an artist.) Yet by the time Endymion was published in April 1818, Keats's name had been identified with Hunt's 'Cockney School,' and the Tory Blackwood's Magazine delivered a violent attack on Keats as an 'ignorant and unsettled pretender' to culture who had no right to aspire to poetry. <br><br>Although the critical reaction to <i>Endymion</i> was infamous for its ferocity, the youthful bard was hardly destroyed by it&#x2014;despite Byron's famous quip that Keats was 'snuffed out by an Article.' The surprising truth is that he entered upon an interval of astonishing productivity, perhaps the most concentrated period of creativity any English poet has ever known. In the summer of 1818, Keats journeyed to Scotland with Charles Brown, the rugged, worldly businessman who was one of his most loyal friends. There he vowed: 'I shall learn poetry here and shall henceforth write more than ever.' That fall he began composing <i>Hyperion,</i> his imitation of and challenge to Milton's <i>Paradise Lost;</i> even critics saw the work as a major achievement. In December, following his brother Tom's death from tuberculosis, Keats went to live with Charles Brown in Wentworth Place, Hampstead. There, almost in spite of himself, the young poet fell helplessly in love with Fanny Brawne, the eighteen-year-old daughter of a widowed neighbor; a year later they were betrothed. In 1819 Keats produced 'The Eve of St. Agnes,' 'La Belle Dame Sans Merci,' the major odes, Lamia, the Dantean dream-vision <i>The Fall of Hyperion,</i> and the five-act verse tragedy <i>Otho the Great</i> (written in collaboration with Brown). <br><br>On February 3, 1820, Keats suffered a pulmonary hemorrhage that signaled an advanced stage of tuberculosis. He quickly broke off his engagement and began what he called a -posthumous existence.' His career as a poet was effectively ended, although the volume <i>Lamia, Isabella, The Eve of St. Agnes, and Other Poems,</i> containing the bulk of Keats's claim to immortality, was published that July. In a desperate attempt to recover his health in a milder climate, Keats sailed for Italy in September accompanied by the painter Joseph Severn. Declining an invitation to stay with Shelley in Pisa, the two arrived in Rome on November 15 and took up residence in rooms overlooking the Piazza di Spagna. John Keats died in Rome on the night of February 23, 1821, and was buried there on February 26 in the Protestant Cemetery. On his deathbed Keats requested that his tombstone bear no name, only the words 'Here lies one whose name was writ in water.''Places of nestling green for Poets made.'<br>Story of Rimini.<br> <br>I STOOD tip-toe upon a little hill, <br>The air was cooling, and so very still, <br>That the sweet buds which with a modest pride <br>Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside, <br>Their scantly leav'd, and finely tapering stems, <br>Had not yet lost those starry diadems <br>Caught from the early sobbing of the morn. <br>The clouds were pure and white as flocks new shorn, <br>And fresh from the clear brook; sweetly they slept <br>On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;10<br>A little noiseless noise among the leaves, <br>Born of the very sigh that silence heaves: <br>For not the faintest motion could be seen <br>Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green. <br>There was wide wand'ring for the greediest eye, <br>To peer about upon variety; <br>Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim, <br>And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim; <br>To picture out the quaint, and curious bending <br>Of a fresh woodland alley, never ending; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;20<br>Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves, <br>Guess where the jaunty streams refresh themselves. <br>I gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free <br>As though the fanning wings of Mercury <br>Had play'd upon my heels: I was light-hearted, <br>And many pleasures to my vision started; <br>So I straightway began to pluck a posey <br>Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy. <br><br>A bush of May flowers with the bees about them; <br>Ah, sure no tasteful nook would be without them; &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014;30<br>And let a lush laburnum oversweep them, <br>And let long grass grow round the roots to keep them <br>Moist, cool and green; and shade the violets, <br>That they may bind the moss in leafy nets. <br>A filbert hedge with wild briar overtwined, <br>And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind <br>Upon their summer thrones; there too should be <br>The frequent chequer of a youngling tree, <br>That with a score of light green brethren shoots <br>From the quaint mossiness of aged roots: &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; 40<br>Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters <br>Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters <br>The spreading blue-bells: it may haply mourn <br>That such fair clusters should be rudely torn <br>From their fresh beds, and scattered thoughtlessly <br>By infant hands, left on the path to die. <br><br>Open afresh your round of starry folds, <br>Ye ardent marigolds! <br>Dry up the moisture from your golden lids, <br>For great Apollo bids &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; 50<br>That in these days your praises should be sung <br>On many harps, which he has lately strung; <br>And when again your dewiness he kisses, <br>Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses: <br>So haply when I rove in some far vale, <br>His mighty voice may come upon the gale. <br><br>Here are sweet peas, on tip-toe for a flight: <br>With wings of gentle flush o'er delicate white, <br>And taper fingers catching at all things, <br>To bind them all about with tiny rings. &#x2014;&#x2014;&#x2014; 60</p><h2>The Runner&#39;s World Vegetarian Cookbook: 150 Delicious and Nutritious Meatless Recipes to Fuel Your Every Step</h2><p><b>150 delicious meatless recipes packed with performance-boosting nutrients</b><br>&nbsp;<br>As a runner, you know that your food is your fuel&#x2014;you have to eat well in order to perform well.

Stefan Bollmann&#x2019;s <i>Women Who Read Are Dangerous</i> explores this popular subject in more than 70 artworks drawings, paintings, photographs, and prints by iconic artists such as Henri Matisse, Edward Hopper, Suzanne Valadon, August Sander, Rembrandt, and many more. <br> <br>As the book&#x2019;s provocative title indicates, a woman reading was once viewed as radical.

Bollmann offers intelligent and engaging commentary on each work of art in <i>Women Who Read Are Dangerous</i>, telling us who the subject is, her relationship to the artist, and even what she is reading.

The series includes three Pulitzer Prize winners, two <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers, and winners of the Bancroft and Parkman Prizes. Now, in the newest volume in the series, one of America's most esteemed historians, Gordon S. Wood, offers a brilliant account of the early American Republic, ranging from 1789 and the beginning of the national government to the end of the War of 1812.<br> As Wood reveals, the period was marked by tumultuous change in all aspects of American life in politics, society, economy, and culture. The men who founded the new government had high hopes for the future, but few of their hopes and dreams worked out quite as they expected. They hated political parties but parties nonetheless emerged. Some wanted the United States to become a great fiscal military state like those of Britain and France; others wanted the country to remain a rural agricultural state very different from the European states. Instead, by 1815 the United States became something neither group anticipated. Many leaders expected American culture to flourish and surpass that of Europe; instead it became popularized and vulgarized. The leaders also hope to see the end of slavery; instead, despite the release of many slaves and the end of slavery in the North, slavery was stronger in 1815 than it had been in 1789. Many wanted to avoid entanglements with Europe, but instead the country became involved in Europe's wars and ended up waging another war with the former mother country. Still, with a new generation emerging by 1815, most Americans were confident and optimistic about the future of their country. <br> Named a <em>New York Times</em> Notable Book, <em>Empire of Liberty</em> offers a marvelous account of this pivotal era when America took its first unsteady steps as a new and rapidly expanding nation.<br></p><p><p></p><strong>Take a Look Inside the <i>Empire of Liberty</i> [Click on Images to Enlarge]</strong> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><br> George Washington (1732&#x2013;1799): This portrait painted by Gilbert Stuart in 1797 was the one rescued by Dolley Madison in 1814 when the British burned the White House.<br> (Library of Congress) </td> </tr> </tbody></table> </td><td> <table> <tbody><tr> <td><br> Lyon-Griswold Brawl (1798): Outraged by this brawl on the floor of the House of Representatives, many concluded that Congress had become contemptible in the eyes of all &#x201c;polite or genteel&#x201d; societies.

But as a new century approached, appetites broadened, and David Fairchild, a young botanist with an insatiable lust to explore and experience the world, set out in search of foods that would enrich the American farmer and enchant the American eater.<br><br>Kale from Croatia, mangoes from India, and hops from Bavaria. Peaches from China, avocados from Chile, and pomegranates from Malta. Fairchild&#x2019;s finds weren&#x2019;t just limited to food: From Egypt he sent back a variety of cotton that revolutionized an industry, and via Japan he introduced the cherry blossom tree, forever brightening America&#x2019;s capital. Along the way, he was arrested, caught diseases, and bargained with island tribes. But his culinary ambition came during a formative era, and through him, America transformed into the most diverse food system ever created.</p><p><b>Daniel Stone&nbsp;</b>is a staff writer for&nbsp;<i>National Geographic</i>&nbsp;and a former White House correspondent for&nbsp;<i>Newsweek</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Daily Beast</i>. A native of Los Angeles, he holds degrees from UC Davis and Johns Hopkins University.Chapter One<br><br> Chance Encounters<br><br> The trip had been punishing, a rocky overnight voyage over rough seas. Humid air, the kind that clings to one's face, stifled romantic visions of the Mediterranean. Even David Fairchild, a twenty-five-year-old from the prairielands of Kansas, was surprised by the small town of Bastia, Corsica's eastern outpost where the boat docked. "I had been accustomed to a certain degree of dirt but the town of Bastia appeared unbelievably filthy," he wrote of his first impression. Shabby dogs circled him on the dusty street as he stumbled around, disoriented, in the early light of day.<br><br> Had he been closer to home, he'd have found the scene easier to stomach. But here, on the French island, Fairchild was as far as anyone in his family had ever ventured. His journey had taken him from Kansas to Washington, across the Atlantic to Italy, north to Germany, and then south again across the Alps to the port where he met the boat. Such distance might have filled him with pride or pleasure if the last leg hadn't stirred a deep ailing in his stomach.<br><br> Sometime during the night, it had become December 17, 1894. Fairchild had spent his youth dreaming of traveling overseas, and now, finally, he was on his first assignment. He waited for the post office to open, and when it did, a man handed him an envelope crowded with forwarding addresses, and inside, a short message.<br><br> Secretary refuses authorization.<br><br> As an agent for the United States government, Fairchild had been cautioned to keep secret his mission in Corsica. This sort of undertaking had rarely been tried, and without a treaty or informal diplomatic agreement, or even the definitive knowledge that such a visit was legal, the best Washington could hope for was that its man could get in and out without causing a scene.<br><br> Fairchild had little direction and, as had now become clear, even less money. The order from the secretary of agriculture to go to Corsica had been nullified by the same man, who refused to cable money for his agent to complete the job. Fairchild liked the idea of espionage, but he was as skilled at covert action as he was at ballroom dancing, having done neither. He was a botanist, an agent of plants, and not a good one.<br><br> Without money, Fairchild couldn't afford to stay long. But already on the island, he figured he might as well try to complete the objective. He flagged a cab drawn by a single horse that trotted south along the coast. To think clearly, he needed to eat. He also needed a lead. Corsica was hilly, hot, and too big to wander blindly.<br><br> He stopped at a roadside restaurant, where he was the only customer. While he waited to eat, he mentioned casually to the restaurant's owner that he was interested in plants. Where, he asked in a mix of English, broken Italian, and arm gestures, could he see some of the island's trees? Perhaps its famous citron?<br><br> The man lit with purpose. He took Fairchild behind the restaurant to sample figs he had grown, each one a mouthful of syrup. He suggested that Fairchild see the mayor of Borgo, a town at the top of a nearby mountain in the center of the citron region, and gave Fairchild a note of introduction. "There I was, with an adventure on my hands, and I enjoyed it," Fairchild wrote. He walked outside and hired a donkey to carry him up, observing the view at every switchback up the mountain, oblivious to the fact that Corsicans could be wary of outsiders.<br><br> The mayor of Borgo was a red-faced man, skin baggy and sagging, "a bandit of a fellow," Fairchild jotted in his red pocket notebook. The mayor's house sat on wooden stilts atop a pigsty caked in mud. Fairchild had to navigate the snorting beasts to deliver the note from the man who had served him lunch.<br><br> As he might have expected, the mayor spoke no English and Fairchild knew almost no French, but the mayor made it understood that he had to leave for a funeral. He poured Fairchild a glass of wine and told his guest to wait. When the mayor left, Fairchild noticed a gray patch of mold floating on the wine and emptied it through a crack in the floorboards onto the pigs. Then he moved to the window, where he looked for a long moment at the deep valleys and orchards filled with fruit. It occurred to him: So long as he was waiting, what difference would it make to wait outside?<br><br> Efforts to be inconspicuous were betrayed by his large camera, an Eastman Kodet that folded like an accordion and had a cloth curtain. On the street, a small crowd gathered around him murmuring about the peculiar contraption and the man holding it. He stopped to photograph a group of women in long black skirts. A man urged Fairchild to photograph the view off the side of the mountain. Another woman asked him to take an image of her daughter. He obliged the woman's request but ignored the man, who turned and marched away.<br><br> While his head was concealed by the curtain, he felt someone grab his arm.<br><br> "Vos papiers, s'il vous pla&#x201d;t."<br><br> It was a policeman. Or perhaps a soldier.<br><br> Fairchild had no papers to show, nor could he respond in a way the man understood. The minimal French learned in school left his head at the precise moment it might have been useful.<br><br> In just a few hours on the island, two hours into his first assignment working in a foreign land on behalf of the American government, Fairchild found himself arrested. If he knew anything about this type of work, he demonstrated the opposite. He had made his mission known to a government official. He had drawn attention to himself in the streets. And worst of all, he would now be interrogated. If he couldn't hold his resolve, the man would compel him to divulge what he had come for, and who had sent him.<br><br> The gendarme escorted Fairchild to a small house that doubled as the town's jail. He gestured for Fairchild to empty his pockets. The man picked up Fairchild's red pocket notebook and began to thumb through its pages. He asked in staccato what each word meant. Some of the scratches were in English, others in German and Italian, his attempt to practice languages he didn't know. Fairchild was filled half with fear, half with indignation, neither of which compelled him to cooperate.<br><br> In the corner of the room sat a woman in a black robe with a baby perched at her breast. As she rocked, she barked orders in Corsican French to the man. He paid her no attention, his gaze affixed on the notebook.<br><br> It struck Fairchild that the man mistook him for a spy, which he technically was, but the kind seeking more serious secrets. How else to explain the notebook with suspicious writings? Why the camera? Owing to the heat, his growing annoyance, and the creeping fear that he could spend his life in a Corsican prison, blood began to rush from Fairchild's face. "On an errand that was not likely to be pleasing if explained to the guard, with no papers in my pocket, with a captor whose very look was enough to terrify anyone, and in a jail that would rival in filthiness any that the Inquisition ever had, I think there are few men who would not have paled," he later wrote.<br><br> The policeman was familiar with the game of espionage, with foreigners arriving innocently but looking for political or economic secrets-or worse, to survey the land's value. The island had been war-torn for centuries, a plaything of European empires that fought for the rights to a Mediterranean oasis rich in crops, water, and fertile soil. America wasn't a threat, but the superpower Spain was, as was Italy, France's neighbor, which saw rich promise in a nearby island. A European spy hoping to steal strategic secrets from Corsica would be wise to impersonate a bumbling American who could barely speak French.<br><br> If the money had arrived from Washington, Fairchild would have had papers to prove his identity, his employer, and his mission, which, at the very least, was less threatening than looking for military secrets. Instead, all he had remaining in the bottom of his pockets was an old reimbursement check for fifteen dollars for work as a government contractor.<br><br> With nothing left to offer, Fairchild tossed the crumpled envelope containing the check onto the desk. But something caught both men's eyes. There on the envelope was the muscular visage of Ulysses S. Grant.<br><br> "Oo-lissies Grant," Fairchild said, pointing at the imprint. "Americano!"<br><br> The woman with the baby stared.<br><br> The man held the envelope up to study it. He seemed more taken by Grant's brawny gaze than by Fairchild's flailing insistence.<br><br> Then slowly, he pushed the red notebook back at Fairchild and uttered a string of words that sounded like a warning never to come back.<br><br> Fairchild stumbled out of the house, sweating lightly and breathing hard. With his head down he walked past the group of Corsicans watching him, then hoisted himself onto the donkey he had hired and kicked its side. As the animal trotted away, Fairchild peered over his shoulder every few paces, wary of being pursued.<br><br> Halfway down the mountain, when he felt confident he wasn't being followed, he dismounted. An orchard of yellow fruit had caught his eye, and he dashed into the grove of citron trees. He checked over both shoulders as he crouched in the dirt. Then he broke off four small bud sticks, the part of the tree where two thin branches merge into one. He tucked them into his breast pocket. These cuttings could later be grown into new trees, the Corsican citron mimicked in American soil. Then he plucked three small fruit from the tree's branches. If the buds didn't survive, the seeds inside these citrons might.<br><br> Back on the trail, Fairchild slowed the donkey. Success was in reach, but only if he could safely leave the island. The smartest thing he could do was to depart Corsica from a different city, where port agents wouldn't recognize him or have reason to inspect his camera and search his pockets.<br><br> In Bastia, he hailed another horse-drawn cab to drive him to the west-side city of Ajaccio. There, he asked an old man in an orchard for one of the few French terms he did remember, pommes de terre, potatoes. Fairchild paid for the stolen citron buds with agricultural knowledge: he demonstrated for the man a method he had once read about in a book-he stuck the sticks into the starchy centers of potatoes so that the cuttings would survive the lengthy trip to Washington. The freight bill would be a few cents. And after that, the remaining coins dangling in Fairchild's pocket were just enough to get him back to Naples.<br><br> The United States, barely a century old, was still young. The continent may have been green and vibrant, but as a culinary canvas, it was still fresh and white in 1869, the year David Fairchild was born one April day on the thawing plains of Lansing, Michigan.<br><br> America at one hundred hadn't developed a culinary identity of its own; there wasn't anything that could reasonably be called "American food." The choice of what to eat was most often confined to the items English colonists had brought over from their native land: meats and cheeses. Only the southern states could farm year-round, and when they did, root vegetables sprouted easiest, cabbage and green beans with a bit of extra work. "The fare of the Puritan farmers was as frugal as it was wholesome," Ben Perley Poore, a newspaper columnist, wrote in 1856 about the food of America's early days. "Porridge for breakfast; bread, cheese, and beer or cider for luncheon; a 'boiled dish,' or 'black broth,' or salt fish, or broiled pork, or baked beans, for dinner; hasty pudding and milk for supper." Slaves tended to get leftovers, and if there were none, they'd subsist on a combination of rice, beans, and potatoes.<br><br> Luck was the most critical factor in cultivating wheat. Bread was the product of corn, wheat, or rye, and in the harshest winters, most households could usually rely on bread, butter, and bacon. People preferred pigs to other proteins for the animal's indiscriminate diet, low water needs, and high calorie count. Flavor came in a distant fourth.<br><br> Fruits and vegetables were rare, and as a result, all things that sprouted from soil were dubious to medical authorities. "Woody tissue" was harder to process than animal muscle, which more closely resembled human flesh. Besides, the fruits of trees and shrubs were unpredictable, grown on such small scale and rejected by farmers who couldn't afford risks.<br><br> Food in every way was bland. Meals had bigger things to accomplish than merely to taste good. The food a person ate had a curious link to every aspect of his behavior, down even to his sexuality. The nineteenth century's avant-garde dieting theory came from Sylvester Graham, a Connecticut culinary reformer who developed a cracker-named after himself-to calm the body's "urges," sexual and otherwise. Women were said to faint at his speeches. Charles Elm Francatelli, the closest thing the era had to a celebrity chef, warned in his popular 1846 cookbook, The Modern Cook, that "excess in the quantity and variety of spices and condiments . . . is especially to be guarded against. Nothing vitiates the palate more than a superabundant use of such stimulants." A generation later in 1875, George Napheys, a Philadelphia doctor, warned that highly seasoned food would stunt a person's development. Cravings of any kind were signs of weakness, he said, omens that a person wasn't properly "brought up."<br><br> There were right ways and wrong ways to eat food. Warnings percolated everywhere, in newspapers, in circulars, buzzed about in community centers. Sarah Tyson Rorer, the nineteenth century's Martha Stewart, issued a series of cookbooks that traded polite suggestion for blunt bossiness. In her most famous tome, Good Cooking, she advised:<br><br> Eat only the proper amount for necessary nutrition; avoid excessive sweet mixtures, fried foods, complicated pastries, acids, such as pickles or foods covered with vinegar, excessively hot or very cold foods, or ice water, which is the most objectionable of liquids. A frequent cause of indigestion is the mingling of too great a variety of food in the mouth. Take one food, masticate and swallow it; then another. Do not take a mouthful of toast and then a swallow of tea, unless you wish to be a still further sufferer from indigestion.<br><br> Indigestion, otherwise known as dyspepsia, was the era's fashionable disease, which seemed to arrive in America so suddenly that no one could reasonably explain it. Some blamed it on eating hot foods with cold; others faulted the anxiety wives felt when their husbands left home for the workday. Indigestion provided an opening for some people to argue that stomach discomfort was a sure sign the country had degenerated from the greatness of the colonial period. The implied warning was that unless people changed their ways, starting with their diet, America's grand experiment in constitutional democracy would flame out.<br><br>When young Fairchild was learning to walk in the early 1870s, the purpose of food had begun to shift from survival and sufficiency to something resembling gastronomic pleasure. <i>The American Home&nbsp;Cook Book </i>proposed cooking eels with a little parsley.

These courageous dragonriders arrived from the past, traveling four hundred years to help their descendants survive. But the collision of past and present took its toll. While most of the displaced rescuers adapted to their new reality, others could not abide the jarring change and found themselves in soul-crushing exile, where unhappiness and resentment seethed.<br><br>Piemur, a journeyman harper, also feels displaced, cast adrift by the loss of his spectacular boyhood voice and uncertain of his future. But when the Masterharper of Pern sees promise in the young man and sends him undercover among the exiled Oldtimers, Piemur senses the looming catastrophe that threatens the balance of power between the Weyrs and Holds of Pern.<br><br> When the unthinkable happens, Piemur must rise to the challenge to avert disaster and restore honor to the dragons and dragonriders of Pern. Because now, in a world already beset by Thread, another, more insidious danger looms: For the first time in living memory, dragons may be on the verge of fighting dragons.</p><p><b>Gigi McCaffrey</b> collaborated with her late mother, Anne McCaffrey, on three short stories collected in the anthologies <i>Great Writers &amp; Kids Write Spooky Stories </i>and<i> Mothers &amp; Daughters</i>. She also contributed an essay to <i>Dragonwriter: A Tribute to Anne McCaffrey and Pern, </i>edited by her brother Todd McCaffrey. She lives in the Devil&#x2019;s Glen, in Ireland&#x2019;s Wicklow County, with her husband, their son, and their infamous hound, Sidney.ONE<br><br>Clouds of warm, dust-laden air billowed down around Piemur and whipped off his floppy hat as hundreds of dragons and their riders lifted off from the ground, steadily filling the sky overhead. Hastily he pulled his tunic over his head to protect his face from flying grit, clamping his mouth shut tight in the process. All the trees and vegetation around the Weyr bucked and buffeted under the huge downdraft generated by the wings of the bronze, brown, blue, and green dragons. Through the protective fabric, Piemur heard the comments the dragonriders called to one another as they took flight; heard, too, the muffled sound of dragons coughing as they rose higher off the ground. Listening, he wondered&#x2014;not for the first time&#x2014;what pernicious ailment still afflicted so many of the dragons of Southern Weyr, and why the Weyr Healer couldn&#x2019;t find a remedy to shift it from their lungs. Only when the sounds receded to almost nothing and he could feel the air settling did he risk uncovering his eyes to look skyward.<br><br>Piemur watched as the sun shimmered off their soft hides and made their jewel-like, faceted eyes sparkle. There was nothing like the sight of a sky full of dragons, he fancied&#x2014;even dragons who were not in the full of their health. The fine membrane that made up the sails of the dragons&#x2019; wings looked nearly transparent, and he wondered how wings that appeared so delicate could bear the weight of such massive creatures.<br><br>Today the Oldtimer dragonriders were traveling to harvest a fresh crop of numbweed, which they would later pound and boil into the noxious unction that, once set, would be used as a hallowed salve. Only twoscore riders and their dragons remained behind in the Weyr with the queens, the most senior of whom had just returned from a lone sojourn. A brown dragon was curled up in a wallow, coughing desultorily as if to dislodge a tiny irritant nestled deep inside his vast lungs. His rider rested with him, in the curve of his forelegs.<br><br>A few other dragons basked in their wallows or relaxed under the ministrations of their riders, while the rest simply slept, their old bones soaking up the plentiful sunshine. Numerous weyrfolk&#x2014;men and women who lived at the Weyr but were not dragonriders&#x2014;went about the compound, washing or tending to clothing, preparing food, or assisting the older dragonriders with the task of bathing and oiling their dragon&#x2019;s soft hides. Nothing was more important than caring for the dragons. With their abilities to fly, teleport, and breathe fire, the dragons were the best and most effective weapon the world had against its mindless enemy, Thread&#x2014;an insatiable organism that, when the orbit of its host planet was close enough to Pern, would shower down in a fifty-Turn cycle, devouring anything organic in its path. And if the dragons couldn&#x2019;t char every last Thread from the skies before they touched ground, the deadly strands would burrow underground to continue their terrible course of destruction. The dragons were truly the most precious things on the planet, and supporting them and their riders was the job&#x2014;either directly or indirectly&#x2014;of every person in or outside of the Weyrs.<br><br>But Southern Weyr no longer had that kind of support. The Oldtimer dragonriders had cut ties with Benden, the premier Weyr in the northern hemisphere, effectively alienating themselves from their peers and, ultimately, everyone else. Never in living memory had any group broken free, seeking to go it alone in the hostile environment of Pern without the support of the other elements of their social structure.<br><br>Piemur was here at the behest of his mentor, Masterharper Robinton. He hadn&#x2019;t started out as a spy. Three Turns earlier, Piemur had been virtually wrenched from his comfortable position in the Harper Hall and sent to the Southern Hold to teach the resident harper the new drum measures, vital for maintaining communications with neighboring smallholdings. But it hadn&#x2019;t taken long for Saneter to memorize the new measures . . . and for the Masterharper to task Piemur with a seemingly endless stream of structureless chores, almost all of which were completely outside his training as a singer. If not for his deep-rooted sense of loyalty to his craft and his mentor, Piemur would have gladly forgone the exhausting and never-ending job of mapping Southern, a vast continent far larger than anyone had ever imagined and, in many areas, actually impassable.<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t mind standing in to teach the local children when Saneter was away or indisposed. In fact, he quite enjoyed passing on the information contained in the teaching ballads, imperative for every child to know in order to survive. And the mapping, while often monotonous, hot, and uncomfortable, sometimes had its moments of discovery and adventure. Piemur&#x2019;s most unsatisfying task by far, and the one he found so disturbing to perform, was as a spy: observing and assessing the demeanor and welfare of the dragonriders of Southern Weyr. He gleaned no joy in snooping around the noble dragons and their riders, pretending to be someone he was not, visiting the Weyr on one pretense or another while trying to catch every snippet of conversation or grievance he could. It felt grossly wrong to Piemur to behave so duplicitously toward a group of dragons and riders who had spent a lifetime defending the planet. But the Masterharper, in his role as Pern&#x2019;s custodian of culture and heritage, and the discreet harmonizer of her interconnected social relationships, was anxious to know how the outcasts were faring. He regularly stressed how important it was for Piemur to take note of any little details in the Weyr&#x2019;s daily life that might be the slightest bit out of the ordinary, and report these. The most trivial snippet could be what helped to reunite Southern Weyr with the rest of dragonkind&#x2014;and as a harper, Piemur was trained to observe details.<br><br>So he noticed when T&#x2019;reb landed his green dragon and, instead of flying out again to harvest numbweed with the other members of the Weyr, headed for B&#x2019;naj&#x2019;s dwelling. To Piemur&#x2019;s sharp eye, the subtle signs of agitation in the green rider&#x2019;s posture were unmistakable. Straightening his tunic over the top of his loose leggings, then scooping up his hat and setting it firmly back on his head, Piemur moved from the shade of the trees to cross the compound in the direction T&#x2019;reb had taken.<br><br>Trying to look nonchalant, Piemur circled around B&#x2019;naj&#x2019;s wooden cabin so he could eavesdrop from the quiet side of the building where leafy trees offered him a hiding place from which to remain unobserved. Once behind the building he dropped down onto his hands and knees, crawling quickly toward a pair of open windows. He sat on the ground, his back pressed hard to the wall of the cabin, head cocked to one side as he tried to make out what was going on inside. He could clearly hear the sound of feet pacing.<br><br>T&#x2019;reb was talking hurriedly, his voice several octaves higher than was comfortable for Piemur&#x2019;s trained ear. No doubt: T&#x2019;reb was very upset.<br><br>&#x201c;My mind is made up now, B&#x2019;naj. No more dithering over what&#x2019;s right or wrong. I&#x2019;ve arranged to meet him and set everything in motion.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Calm down, T&#x2019;reb.&#x201d; That was B&#x2019;naj&#x2019;s voice, speaking in a placating tone.<br><br>&#x201c;But don&#x2019;t you see, B&#x2019;naj? We have to do something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Maybe you&#x2019;re overreacting,&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj said.<br><br>&#x201c;But you didn&#x2019;t see her, B&#x2019;naj. It was unbearable!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What exactly did you see, my friend?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mardra! Trying to coax Loranth from the Hatching Grounds. She was moaning.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mardra or Loranth?&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Loranth, you dolt!&#x201d;<br><br>There was silence for a few moments, and Piemur could only surmise that B&#x2019;naj was glaring at T&#x2019;reb in response to the ill-mannered remark.<br><br>&#x201c;It was like no other dragon sound I&#x2019;ve heard before,&#x201d; T&#x2019;reb continued finally. &#x201c;It put my nerves on edge.&#x201d;<br><br>Not a hard thing to do, Piemur mused, knowing how volatile T&#x2019;reb could be&#x2014;even at the best of times.<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t the usual keening, nor the sound dragons make while feeding; no, it was a slow, heart-wrenching rumbling that came from deep inside. And the sound kept increasing, B&#x2019;naj, to a cry so pitiful I thought she was in mortal agony.&#x201d;<br><br>Piemur heard B&#x2019;naj murmur something indistinguishable, and then T&#x2019;reb continued.<br><br>&#x201c;Mardra was pleading with Loranth: &#x2018;Come away, my love,&#x2019; she said, &#x2018;we cannot keep revisiting this loss.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>Loss? What loss? Piemur wondered. What was T&#x2019;reb talking about? And why was Mardra at the Hatching Grounds when the Weyr didn&#x2019;t even have a new clutch of eggs to harden? Perhaps the old queen and her rider were simply visiting the Grounds, a hallowed place for all dragonkind, to ensure that they were still, as was the custom, in perfect order?<br><br>&#x201c;Such a note of despair was in her voice, B&#x2019;naj. I saw her weeping, and I thought I might weep with her, too. I can&#x2019;t get the image out of my head!&#x201d;<br><br>No wonder T&#x2019;reb appeared so edgy, Piemur mused. What could possibly be causing the Weyr&#x2019;s senior queen dragon so much distress?<br><br>&#x201c;But what were they doing there?&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Loranth dug up those old egg shards and was poking around at them,&#x201d; T&#x2019;reb replied.<br><br>Egg shards? Piemur felt a moment of confusion. Why had the queen dug up old eggshells? Hatching Grounds were revered among dragonmen and -women! Everyone knew that the Grounds were where the future riders first met the young dragons they would partner; the place where, for the very first time in their lives, the specially chosen men and women would form their unique mental bonds with the giant, fearless, and noble creatures. To make that bond, to Impress a dragon, was to make a telepathic connection so strong that it could never be broken. Piemur had often wondered what it must be like to be a dragonrider, to have the unconditional friendship, love, and support of one of those magnificent beasts, a bond so strong that it lasted for life. From what he understood, the wondrous relationship he shared with his own Farli, his little golden fire-lizard, was only a tiny fraction of the deep connection between dragon and rider.<br><br>Piemur gave himself a mental shake; he couldn&#x2019;t let his thoughts distract him, or he might miss a crucial exchange between T&#x2019;reb and B&#x2019;naj.<br><br>&#x201c;The Hatching Grounds should&#x2019;ve been thoroughly cleared ages ago. It&#x2019;s not proper for the queen to do that, nor to leave the place in such a state.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, but Mardra wouldn&#x2019;t have it, would she?&#x201d; The pitch of T&#x2019;reb&#x2019;s voice was rising again.<br><br>&#x201c;And no amount of weeping or moaning will change the fact that Loranth won&#x2019;t produce any new clutches of eggs. She&#x2019;s just too old.&#x201d; Piemur thought he heard a note of sadness in B&#x2019;naj&#x2019;s voice.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more than that, B&#x2019;naj.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Loranth has been off color ever since that shaft collapsed when the Weyr was mining firestone. I&#x2019;m glad I didn&#x2019;t go with you and the others.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We should never have gone on that cursed venture&#x2014;over half the Weyr was exposed to those noxious fumes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, yes, we&#x2019;ve spoken about this already. And we still cannot change what is done, T&#x2019;reb!&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj was growing impatient.<br><br>&#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t just sit by as the Weyr falls apart. That&#x2019;s why we have to do something now!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a matter for our Weyrleader, T&#x2019;reb, not us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ha! You still think T&#x2019;ron will do something? He&#x2019;s no more use to us now than a spent glow in a basket!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Shh, keep your voice down!&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj hissed.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to stand by anymore, B&#x2019;naj. We have a duty to our queen and our Weyr!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What are you up to?&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj asked.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s this plan&#x2014;half-cocked at that&#x2014;but perhaps we can use it to our advantage.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What plan, T&#x2019;reb? You can&#x2019;t go behind our Weyrleader&#x2019;s back, my friend.&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj sounded alarmed.<br><br>&#x201c;During my sojourns north, I traded with a group of men from Nabol. One of them pointed out similarities between us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Similarities? What are you talking about, T&#x2019;reb? They aren&#x2019;t dragonfolk!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, they aren&#x2019;t, but just like us they&#x2019;ve fallen afoul of Benden!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj said.<br><br>&#x201c;When they sought help over a family feud, Benden said they couldn&#x2019;t interfere in Hold matters. Benden&#x2014;F&#x2019;lar and Lessa so high and mighty, as if their Weyr rules all the rest! Some leaders, yeah? Left those Nabolese out in the cold just like those other meddlers, the harpers. Honestly, B&#x2019;naj, I hardly listened to all the details of their silly feud. The nub of it is that they want us to help secure a holding promised to their father by Lord Meron.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Meron,&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj said, enunciating the two syllables slowly and with so much distaste in his voice that Piemur had little difficulty imagining the dragonrider&#x2019;s facial expression. And no surprise there: The late Lord Meron had been cruel and uncaring; even Piemur had fallen afoul of the Lord Holder. &#x201c;He always was a sneaky lick of a man. We never should&#x2019;ve traded with him.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But we did, and strange as it now seems, his kin may actually have thought of an idea that will benefit our Weyr. We just have to assist them in securing lands to hold.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They can have plenty of land down here&#x2014;as much as they like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t travel south.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They say they can&#x2019;t stomach the sea crossing. And anyway, they want lands in the north&#x2014;just as was promised to them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And what would we get in return?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Exactly what we need, B&#x2019;naj. New blood.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How in the name of the First Egg&#x2014;&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj&#x2019;s response increased in volume until T&#x2019;reb cut him short.<br><br>&#x201c;Shh!&#x201d; T&#x2019;reb said.<br><br>A long silence followed.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; B&#x2019;naj asked at last, and Piemur guessed that T&#x2019;reb must have whispered something. He tried to press his ear even closer to the cabin wall. There was the sound of movement inside and a low murmuring, but Piemur couldn&#x2019;t make out what was said. He held his breath, straining harder to hear the two dragonriders. Suddenly a chair scraped against the floor and Piemur heard what sounded like a hand slapping bare flesh.<br><br>&#x201c;You cannot stop me, B&#x2019;naj!&#x201d; T&#x2019;reb said heatedly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s obvious to me now, the less you know the better.&#x201d;<br><br>What had T&#x2019;reb said? Shards and fire blast! Piemur wished he&#x2019;d been able to hear. It felt like all the hair on his body was standing on end, warning him of some ominous event in the offing, as sure as the dreaded Thread fell from the sky.<br><br>Footsteps marched purposefully inside the cabin, and then there was the sound of the door opening. Piemur crouch-crawled quickly to the end of the cabin and then ducked around the corner. From his new hiding place, he could see T&#x2019;reb marching across the compound toward his dragon, Beth.<br><br>Without a backward glance, T&#x2019;reb approached Beth and grabbed her flying harness. The green dragon turned toward her rider, and Piemur saw the color of her many-faceted eyes change from a soft green to a darker hue that was flecked with amber. Beth&#x2019;s not a happy dragon, he observed in silence.</p><h2>Papa&#39;s Mechanical Fish</h2><p><p>Candace Fleming and illustrator Boris Kulikov pair up to tell a fun story about a real submarine inventor in<i> Papa's Mechanical Fish</i></p><p><i>Clink!

Papa theorizes and tinkers but never succeeds. Finally, while the family is dropping lines from a pier into Lake Michigan, his daughter asks, "have you ever wondered what it's like to be a fish?" Immediately the man dashes back to his workshop and soon produces one of the world's earliest submarines, the Whitefish. Children will delight in the way Virena is the catalyst for her father's successive improvements to his primitive vessel as she continues to ask questions: about how fish move through water, stay dry, and know where they are going. Kulikov's luminous, playful, detailed illustrations on full-bleed spreads incorporate a variety of perspectives, including close-up views of fish and of Papa underwater and cutaway diagrams of his creations.

The only uncertainty is whether or not we will rise to greet it. <br> <br> Alan Christoffersen&#x2019;s diary <br> <br>Several months after I was mugged, stabbed, and left unconscious along the shoulder of Washington&#x2019;s Highway 2, a friend asked me what being stabbed felt like. I told her it hurt.<br> <br>Really, how do you describe pain? Sometimes doctors ask us to rate our pain on a scale from one to ten, as if that number had some reliable meaning. In my opinion there needs to be a more objective rating system, something comparative; like, would you trade what you&#x2019;re feeling for a root canal or maybe half a childbirth?<br> <br>And with what would we compare emotional pain&#x2014;physical pain? Arguably, emotional pain is the greater of the two evils. Sometimes people will inflict physical pain on themselves to dull their emotional anguish. I understand. If I had the choice between being stabbed or losing my wife, McKale, again, the knife has the advantage&#x2014;because if the knife kills me, I stop hurting. If it doesn&#x2019;t kill me, the wound will heal. Either way the pain stops. But no matter what I do, my McKale is never coming back. And I can&#x2019;t imagine that the pain in my heart will ever go away.<br> <br>Still, there is hope&#x2014;not to forget McKale, nor even to understand why I had to lose her&#x2014;but to accept that I did and somehow go on. As a friend recently said to me, no matter what I do, McKale will always be a part of me. The question is, what part&#x2014;a spring of gratitude, or a fountain of bitterness? Someday I&#x2019;ll have to decide. Someday the sun will rise again. The only uncertainty is whether or not I will rise to greet it.<br> <br>In the meantime, what I hope for most is <i>hope</i>. Walking helps. I wish I were walking again right now. I think I&#x2019;d rather be anywhere right now than where I am.<br> <br>� 2011 Richard Paul Evans</p><h2>The Travel Book: A Journey Through Every Country in the World (Lonely Planet)</h2><p><p><i>Lonely Planet: The world's leading travel guide publisher</i> </p><p>Take a journey through every country in the world. 850 images. 230 countries.

So should our love for each other.</b><br><br>Mihee Kim-Kort is a wife, a mom, and a Presbyterian minister. And she's queer. As she became aware of her queer sexuality, Mihee wondered what that meant for her spirituality. But instead of pushing her away from God, it brought her closer to Jesus and taught her how to love better. In <i>Outside the Lines</i>, Mihee shows us how God, in Jesus, is oriented toward us in a radical way. Through the life, work, and witness of Jesus, we see a God who loves us with a queer love, and our faith in that God becomes a queer spirituality--a spirituality that crashes through definitions and moves us outside of the categories of our making. Whenever we love ourselves and our neighbors with the boundary-breaking love of God, we live out this spirituality in the world. With a captivating mix of personal story and biblical analysis, <i>Outside the Lines</i> shows us how each of our bodies fits into the body of Christ. Outside the lines and without exceptions.</p><p><p><b>Mihee Kim-Kort</b> is an ordained Presbyterian minister (PCUSA) and lives with her family in Indiana. She is author of <i>Making Paper Cranes</i> (2012), editor of <i>Streams Run Uphill </i>(2014), and coauthor of <i>Yoked</i> (2016). Her writing can be found in the <i>Christian Century</i>, <i>Sojourners</i>, and <i>On Being</i>. She is pursuing a PhD in Religious Studies at Indiana University (Bloomington).</p><p>"As someone raised in traditional Christian culture regarding sexuality, I applaud Mihee Kim-Kort's new book, <em>Outside the Lines</em>. It invites us all, whatever our sexual self-understanding, to ponder afresh the wonder of what it means to be embodied humans with attractions and desires. It presents queerness as a needed theological viewpoint with unique gifts to offer. And beyond that, this book is beautifully, clearly, courageously written." --Brian D. McLaren, author of <em>A Generous Orthodoxy, The Great Spiritual Migration, Seeking Aliveness</em></p> <p>"Mihee Kim-Kort's <em>Outside the Lines</em> is a work of critical importance. She not only theorizes queerness as a site of theological possibility, she also models how to best craft a book whose form is queer--exceeding the boundaries of discipline and style. <em>Outside the Lines</em> is about the specific and expanded forces of love, intimacy, hospitality, pleasure, grace and the Divine. And Mihee expertly--with immense beauty and care--blends the personal, the political, and the theological in a way that models pastoral care and scholarly inquiry. She wrote a book I wish I had access to as an inquisitive seminarian." --Darnell Moore, activist, speaker, and author of <em>No Ashes in the Fire</em></p> <p>"Mihee Kim-Kort does a beautiful, sacred thing in calling us back to love--love for our bodies, love for one another, but above all, God's relentless love for us. With grace, elegance, and vulnerability, she weaves together elements of theology, church history, and her own story. With the heart of a pastor and the kindness of a friend, she demystifies queerness, opening up expansive possibilities for a liberated, whole life of faith." --Jeff Chu, author of <em>Does Jesus Really Love Me?</em></p> <p>"I needed <em>Outside the Lines</em> more than I knew. This book made me face so many assumptions about God, others, and myself that I was unaware of. This is a book that offers insight and clarity around queerness, around faith, and around what it means to be human. I can't recommend it enough." --Mike McHargue, co-founder of The Liturgists and author of <em>Finding God in the Waves</em></p> <p>"In this moving celebration of queerness, Mihee Kim-Kort casts a vision for the church to become a place of generosity, hospitality, and expansive love. Her reflections on theology and identity help us imagine a church where every person--with all their questions, quirks, and insecurities--is affirmed as a gift. With vulnerability and compassion, Mihee welcomes us into a faith that is vibrant and liberating--a faith where we can exhale and find rest. <em>Outside the Lines</em> gives me hope for who we can become." --Julie Rodgers, writer, speaker, and advocate for LGBTQ Christians</p> <p>"Kim-Kort's work is as personal as her own skin. She sees a thing, sees a body, sees a way of being and calls it by a name, queer. What was once a term of insult is now an honorary, a benediction, a name. In a time of 'othering,' her voice insists on naming--warmly, fiercely, pastorally." -- Nadia Bolz-Weber, author of <em>Accidental Saints</em></p> <p>"This book pulses with passion, a vibrant faith, calling every reader to see beyond convention and embrace the radical love of Jesus. Let Mihee Kim-Kort's words into your heart, and you will never be the same." -- Diana Butler Bass, author of <em>Grateful: The Transformative Power of Giving Thanks</em></p></p><h2>Classic American Short Stories (Dover Large Print Classics)</h2><p><p>Excellent examples of American fiction of the 19th and 20th centuries, these stories have been chosen for their timeless relevance and enduring popularity.

Are there many nights when you dream about kicking the ball, and watching as it soars through the air toward the goal? Would your perfect day include hours on the soccer field? Do you love to watch people play, soaking up everything you can from other soccer-crazy players? Have you ever felt like your soccer team is a second family? Then you're definitely soccer-crazy . . . and this book is definitely for you!</p><p>From training techniques formations and strategies&#x2015;this book has it all!</p></p><p>Erin Downing is a lifelong soccer fanatic. She is the author of more than twenty-five books, including the Quirks series (as Erin Soderberg). She lives in Minnesota with her husband, three young kids, and a soccer-crazy dog.&nbsp;<p>1</p> <p>BECOMING THE BEST</p> <p>THE SECRET TO SOCCER SUCCESS</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>For many soccer-loving girls, the game is all about having a good time&#x2014;and that&#x2019;s exactly what it should be about!</p> <p>Most people play soccer because it&#x2019;s the greatest sport in the world, and it&#x2019;s a ton of fun. If you enjoy soccer just because you like getting together to practice or play with a group of friends who you have a great time with, that&#x2019;s awesome.</p> <p>But some soccer-crazy girls want more than just fun&#x2014;they want to be one of the best. So what are some of the steps that a <i>good</i> soccer player can take to become a <i>great</i> soccer player? To be good, you must love to play. That&#x2019;s obvious. The more you enjoy playing soccer, the more often you will play&#x2014;and, of course, practice (tons and tons of practice), which makes you better. Taking the time to master your sport will make you a much stronger player and will probably lead to you loving soccer even more.</p> <p>There are many good players out there: women who make trapping or dribbling seem like an art form, or girls who can run for hours and still have that extra burst that will get them through the last hard minutes of a long game.</p> <p>But what&#x2019;s the difference between those very good players and the greatest players on earth? One of the most important things great players have is competitive spirit, the re to win that gives them the passion and drive they need to overcome all obstacles. Great players keep their spirits high, even when they&#x2019;re going into a dif cult match or coming off a losing streak. They don&#x2019;t give up&#x2014;ever!</p> <p>Great players also work very hard. They use up every bit of energy at practice, and push themselves to learn and master every aspect of their sport. In her fascinating autobiography and soccer guide, <i>Go for the Goal: A Champion&#x2019;s Giude to Winning in Soccer and Life</i>, Mia Hamm shares something memorable her legendary coach, Anson Dorrance, noted while she was college: &#x201c;The vision of a champion is someone who is bent over, drenched in sweat, at the point of exhaustion when nobody else is watching.&#x201d; Mia and her teammates practiced&#x2014;as a team, and as individuals&#x2014;until they didn&#x2019;t have an ounce of energy left in their bodies. That&#x2019;s how they became the best.</p> <p>If you want to become a truly great player and a soccer champion, you need to focus on soccer almost like it&#x2019;s a full-time job. In many ways, exceling at sports is even harder than working most jobs because of how much time you have to put in to them, and how hard you have to perform.</p> <p>Remember, you are the only person who can make greatness happen for yourself. It&#x2019;s <i>your</i> body and <i>your</i> mind, and you have to make them both work hard. Practice both with your team and alone, prepare for the situations you&#x2019;ll encounter on the eld, and get tough&#x2014;mentally and physically. That&#x2019;s how to follow in the footsteps of some of the best players in the world.</p> <p>To watch people push themselves further than they think they can, it&#x2019;s a beautiful thing.&nbsp;&#x2014;Abby Wambach</p> <p>THE FOUR ELEMENTS OF SOCCER</p> <p>THERE ARE FOUR basic elements that work in harmony to make up the game of soccer: technical, tactical, physical, and psycholocial. All four are essential to your success on the eld, and they&#x2019;re all aspects you&#x2019;ll continue to work to improve throughout your soccer career. We&#x2019;ll talk in more detail about each of these elements throughout the next few sections.</p> <p>If you don&#x2019;t let something break you, you&#x2019;re going to come out stronger in the end.&#x2014;Hope Solo</p> <p>TRAINING ON YOUR OWN</p> <p>THE BEST WAY to get better is to play as often as you can, and to always look for opportunities to improve. That means always attending practices with a good attitude, doing your best to learn from watching others, and working hard on fundamental skills when you&#x2019;re at home, practicing on your own.</p> <p><i>Coach Mike says:</i> &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to be on a team to play soccer. You can play in your backyard or your basement and work on your ball skills in the off-season. Pretend you&#x2019;re scoring goals to win the World Cup. Self-motivation is going to help make you one of the best.&#x201d;</p> <p>SOME BASIC DRILLS YOU CAN DO ON YOUR OWN INCLUDE</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;kicking a ball into a net to practice your shooting</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;practicing passing and throw-ins against the wall of a building or the side of your garage</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;organizing small pickup games with neighborhood friends or a parent</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;playing keep-away with your dog or a friend to work on agility</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;juggling</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;heading practice</p> <p>JUGGLING</p> <p>ONE OF THE MOST important skills you can learn as a soccer player is how to juggle a soccer ball with your feet. Juggling will help you with dribbling and agility&#x2014;important technical and physical skills.</p> <p>When learning how to juggle the ball, the biggest mistakes a beginner makes is not &#x201c;locking&#x201d; her ankle and forgetting to keep her big toe down. The secret to successfully juggling a ball is a combination of (1) concentration, (2) keeping the ball low to the ground, and (3) staying calm.</p> <p>Then practice, practice, practice!</p> <p><i>Coach Mike says:</i> &#x201c;You should try to use as many body parts as possible in practicing juggling because it will help improve your overall ball control and ability to handle balls in the air. However, the majority of your time should be devoted to juggling with your feet, because that&#x2019;s what you will use the most when you play.&#x201d;</p> <p>HEAD IT!</p> <p>SOMETIMES, THE BALL will come ying straight at you through the air. You can either step to the side and let someone else take control, or you can meet it head on&nbsp;&#x2026; literally. There are a couple of things to keep in mind when you practice stopping or passing the ball with your head:</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use your forehead. Hitting the ball with the top of your forehead will give you the best power and more control.</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;It won&#x2019;t hurt. As long as you&#x2019;re hitting the ball with the right part of your head, you&#x2019;re not going to get a goose egg.</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep your eyes open and your mouth closed. You need to see the ball that&#x2019;s coming at you so you can hit it properly. But keep that mouth closed up tight so you don&#x2019;t bite your tongue.</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lock your neck and keep your back nice and loose. Most of the power from a header doesn&#x2019;t come from your neck or head popping forward (ouch!)&#x2014;it comes from the power you can get from arching and snapping your upper body.</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep your chin in. This will help you release your neck muscles when you move into the ball.</p> <p>GO FOR THE GOAL</p> <p>Somewhere behind the athlete you&#x2019;ve become and the hours of practice and the coaches who have pushed you is a little girl who fell in love with the game and never looked back&nbsp;&#x2026; play for her.&nbsp;&#x2014;Mia Hamm</p> <p>Mia Hamm&#x2019;s excellent autobiography and soccer guide, <i>Go for the Goal,</i> is a must-read for soccer-crazy girls. The book is lled with inspiring stories from Hamm&#x2019;s youth, excellent insider tips (and photos) to help with technique and exercises for training at home, and behind-the-scenes stories from Hamm&#x2019;s years on the US Women&#x2019;s National Team.</p> <p>ATTENTION GOALKEEPERS!</p> <p>A GOALKEEPER&#x2019;S BEST DEFENSE against a shot on goal is to catch it. The most effective way to catch the ball when you&#x2019;re in the net is to put your hands up with your ngers spread wide and the tips of your thumbs close together&#x2014;so your hands look like a big W. Using the W, there&#x2019;s almost no chance the ball will squeeze through your hands to knock you on the nose or slip into the net.</p> <p>Sometimes the shot may be coming at you too hard or too fast to allow you to catch it, so in this case you can punch it. A double- sted punch is most effective if the ball is coming right at you, but if it&#x2019;s coming at you from the side, a single punch is your most effective weapon.</p> <p>ROBOKEEPER</p> <p>HOW WOULD YOU like to try to score against a goalkeeping machine? Did you know there&#x2019;s one called RoboKeeper, which is a special robot goalkeeper that has two cameras for eyes? The robot goalkeeper&#x2019;s eyes take ninety pictures per second, and can follow the ball&#x2019;s path from the penalty line to the goal. The information about the ball gets sent to the robot&#x2019;s motor control, telling the RoboKeeper which way to go to defend the shot. All of this communication happens in less than the 0.3 seconds it takes for a ball to make it from the goal line to the net.</p> <p>SOCCER TRICKS</p> <p>STUNTS ON THE PITCH</p> <p>WHEN YOU&#x2019;RE TRAINING at home, there are a few ashy moves you can practice working on to really challenge yourself. Of course, mastering basic technical skills is the most important thing a young player can do&#x2014;but who doesn&#x2019;t want to try a few cool moves from time to time, too? Step-by-step guides for doing some of these moves can be found on eHow.com, and there are a lot of great instructional videos on YouTube as well.</p> <p>BICYCLE KICK:</p> <p>Also called a &#x201c;scissor kick,&#x201d; this is an incredibly dif cult move to perform! You need to be able to throw your body up into the air, then kick one leg in front of the other (usually up above the level of your head) without your arms or body touching the ground. A bicycle kick can be executed backwards or sideways. Bicycle kicks take tremendous strength and agility&#x2014;and a whole lot of trial and error when you&#x2019;re learning how to do them.</p> <p>FRONT HANDSPRING THROW-IN:</p> <p>A front handspring throw-in literally involves doing a front handspring toward the touchline with the ball in your hands. You begin your throw-in fteen to twenty feet away from the side of the eld, then take a few steps toward the touchline to give you some momentum for executing a handspring. When you land on your feet again, the force of your handspring will help you throw the ball even further onto the eld. Practice regular front handsprings rst, and once you&#x2019;ve mastered that you can try doing a handspring with the ball in your hands.</p> <p>THE RAINBOW: </p> <p>One of the most famous and ashy moves in soccer, the Rainbow, is also a move that is rarely performed successfully. To do the Rainbow, you step over the ball while you&#x2019;re running forward. Then the ball rolls up your heel, and you ick the ball up and over your head with your leg. If you manage to do it correctly, the ball will y forward over you, making an arc that looks like a rainbow, before landing on the ground in front of you.</p> <p>THE MARADONA: </p> <p>The Maradona is also called the Marseille turn, but is more often referred to as the Maradona because of Diego Maradona, the legendary player who performed the move with great grace and skill. The Maradona is a really cool way to execute a turn&#x2014;where both you <i>and</i> the ball change direction&#x2014;in order to defend the ball in your possession against an oncoming attacker.</p> <p>There are three basic steps to a beginner&#x2019;s Maradona move. rst, you step lightly on the ball with your dominant foot to stop its forward progress. While that foot is resting gently on the ball, you use your other foot to propel your body to begin its spin to face the other direction. Switch to put your weaker foot on the ball, and continue to spin until you&#x2019;re facing the exact opposite direction you&#x2019;d been running just a moment before. Then ick the ball forward with your foot to get it moving again.</p> <p>SOCCER CAMP</p> <p>ONE GREAT WAY TO immerse yourself in the world of soccer for a week or two is to attend a soccer camp in the summer or during a school break. Many cities and towns around the United States run camps that are staffed by high school or college players, professional coaches, or for a lucky few, professional soccer players.</p> <p>At these camps, instructors will run drills and work on fundamentals, while focusing on fun, fun, fun. Soccer camp is a great place to meet other soccer-crazy girls who live in your area who play for other teams and leagues.</p> <p>If you&#x2019;re interested in attending a soccer camp, ask your coach for suggestions, or ask the athletic director at a local high school for recommendations. If you can&#x2019;t nd a camp in your area, you could even consider teaming up with some of your friends to start your own. Talk to a few older players, and see if they&#x2019;d be interested in spending a few afternoons working with you on drills and skills. Or, you could run some fun mini-camps in your yard or at a local park for some of the younger soccer players in your neighborhood&#x2014;sometimes teaching others is the best way to get better yourself.</p> <p>SELECT TEAMS</p> <p>ARE THEY FOR YOU?</p> <p>IF YOU&#x2019;RE THINKING about trying out for a select (or &#x201c;travel&#x201d;) team, there are some things you need to know. Competitive leagues and travel teams require a lot more than just exceptional soccer skills&#x2014;they take sacri ce, time, and a whole lot of hard work.</p> <p>Some soccer-crazy girls are perfectly happy to be playing on their rec or school team, but others want year-round play. They want the chance to live and breathe soccer day in and day out. They can&#x2019;t imagine spending their afternoons and evenings doing anything <i>other</i> than soccer. Their weekends are spent playing games and tournaments, and their weeknights are spent training. Some might even go so far as to say that they don&#x2019;t mind missing parties and sleepovers and school events for games, since soccer matters more to them.</p> <p>If you think being on a select team is for you, make sure you talk to your family about it. After all, someone&#x2019;s going to have to drive you around to your games and practices&#x2014;so you&#x2019;re going to need their support!</p> <p><i>Coach Mike says:</i> &#x201c;Please understand that if you decide to play for a select team, it&#x2019;s a much greater commitment than playing for a recreational team in your neighborhood. Your coach will expect you to be able to practice year-round, and to make soccer a priority.&#x201d;</p> <p>HOW TO</p> <p>STAND OUT</p> <p>AT TRYOUTS</p> <p>SO YOU&#x2019;VE DECIDED to try out for a select team. Congratulations! When the big day arrives, how can you make sure you get noticed as someone the coaches would want on their team?</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be early! Many times, coaches will be keeping their eye on warm-ups, too. And even if they aren&#x2019;t watching warm-ups, if you get there a little early to kick around a ball with a parent or a friend, you&#x2019;ll be ready to go by the time tryouts begin.</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speak up! Often at tryouts, you&#x2019;ll be playing with a team of girls you&#x2019;ve never played with before. Communicate effectively with your new team by letting them know if you or someone else is open, alerting a teammate if someone is running for a pass, or sharing any other important information with your teammates. Also, remember to encourage good plays and be supportive of the players around you. Coaches want leaders, and great communicators are the best leaders.</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do your best! It&#x2019;s essential that you give it your all at tryouts. This isn&#x2019;t the time to sit back and let others shine&#x2014;you need to give one hundred percent and then some, since you&#x2019;ve only got one chance to win the coaches over. Go after the ball, and then do something with it&#x2014;whether that <i>something</i> is dribbling it up the eld to take a shot, passing it to an open teammate, or keeping it out of the net. Play well, play fair, and be supportive of the other people playing out there with you.</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay positive! If you lose the ball, hustle to get it back or make yourself useful elsewhere on the eld. Don&#x2019;t pout, shout, or get angry. Soccer moves fast, so you&#x2019;ve got to bounce back from mistakes quickly or you&#x2019;ll risk being left behind.</p> <p>&#x2022;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stand out! Obviously, great playing is the best way to stand out. But there are other ways to be memorable, too. Perhaps you could...</p></p><h2>Heart and Brain: Body Language: An Awkward Yeti Collection (Volume 3)</h2><p>From the <i>New York Time</i>s bestselling creator of the hugely popular <i>Awkward Yeti</i> comics&nbsp;comes the third collection in his&nbsp;<i>Heart and Brain</i> series.<br><br><i>Heart and Brain: Body Language </i>continues the adventures of the loveably conflicted sentimental Heart and rational Brain, as well as other bodily inhabitants&nbsp;like Gallbladder, Muscle, and Tongue.<br>&nbsp;<br>Warm-hearted and laugh-out-loud funny, these comics bring our inner struggles to vibrant, humorous life.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>The Awkward Yeti</i> was created by cartoonist Nick Seluk in late 2012, followed by the Heart and Brain spinoff in 2014.<br><br>Nick pursued his lifelong dream of being a professional cartoonist after serving nine years in the corporate world as a graphic designer.

It&#x2019;s almost as if people inject their true nature&#x2014;those passions and priorities and all the intimate details of the heart&#x2014;into the very fabric of the place they call home.<br><br>Just look at the big cities of the world, and you&#x2019;ll see human nature written in their architecture. The beautiful fa�ades of London, one of the world&#x2019;s leading financial centers, practically drip with wealth and power. The glassy skyscrapers of Dubai stand as an outward expression of an inward love of achievement. When we spend enough time somewhere, we have a tendency to build it in our own likeness.<br><br>And that&#x2019;s true of the darker aspects of life as well. Think of the number of cities in America with neighborhoods built around social status or ethnic identity. Or the bright, attractive lights of Las Vegas surrounded by barren desert, as if that tug-of-war between our desperation and dreams had come to life. Our cities are a part of us. In some ways, they are us.<br><br>Cities are often described as being alive, as having a pulse and a heart, and we, the people, are their blood. We personify them to the point where they are indistinguishable from the humans who built them. In 1946, the well-known American-turned-British-aristocrat Lady Astor visited the city of Savannah, Georgia, and described it as &#x201c;very much like a beautiful woman with a dirty face.&#x201d; It had an aura about it, something dark and unclean, that seemed to blur the obvious beauty of the place. And maybe she was on to something. In the decades since, Savannah has become known as the most haunted city in America. <br><br>Now, I&#x2019;m not sure how you measure that sort of characteristic, or if you can even declare something like that to be an indisputable fact. Still, according to those who live there, Savannah is home to a lot more darkness than we might realize.<br><br>And considering its grim past, it&#x2019;s easy to understand why.<br><br>Ebb and Flow<br><br>When Americans talk about the original thirteen colonies, they&#x2019;re talking about the seeds that grew into the country we have today. Thirteen separate settlements that grew into territories, and then&#x2014;eventually&#x2014;the first thirteen American states. The oldest colony, Virginia, dates back to 1607, while Georgia didn&#x2019;t receive a charter until over a century later, in 1732. They were the last to show up at the party, so to speak.<br><br>The leader of the Georgia colony was a man named James Oglethorpe, and he had two very specific goals for the settlement there. First, it would be a buffer territory between the other British colonies to the north and the Spanish to the south. And so slavery was actually illegal, because Oglethorpe didn&#x2019;t want a colony full of soft, lazy white men; he wanted soldiers.<br><br>Second, he envisioned Georgia as a new home for the hopeless of England. People who had served time in jail for debt but were trying to rebuild their lives. Or&#x2014;as Oglethorpe described them&#x2014;the &#x201c;worthy&#x201d; poor. It was meant to be a humble community, with smaller estates and more purpose behind the land division.<br><br>Oglethorpe and his team of 120 colonists arrived on February 12, 1733, and immediately did what English settlers were experts at doing: they approached the indigenous people who already lived there and negotiated for the best land. As a result, those original native inhabitants had to move inland. Shocking, I know.<br><br>Oglethorpe&#x2019;s prize was a bluff overlooking the mouth of the river, and it was there that he laid the foundation for a new city. He called it Savannah, named after the river itself, and set about planning every square foot of the place. In fact, it was America&#x2019;s first planned city, with an almost obsessive arrangement of public squares surrounded by streets aligned to a tidy grid. And I&#x2019;m going to be honest with you&#x2014;as a former designer, I love it.<br><br>Four decades later, after the colonies broke off from England, Georgia legalized the ownership and forced labor of other human beings, allowing rich white Georgians to build a powerful economy on the backs of slaves. In fact, years later, in 1859, Savannah would be the location of one of the largest sales of human lives in American history. Nearly 450 men, women, and children were sold over the course of two days, breaking up nearly a hundred families. It&#x2019;s said that torrential rains fell during the entire event, leading those who were trapped in that system to refer to it as &#x201c;the Weeping Time,&#x201d; as if the heavens themselves were broken by the tragedy of it all.<br><br>Slaves allowed the rich to get richer in Georgia, and as the port city, Savannah became the place through which all that wealth flowed. But it wasn&#x2019;t all sunshine and roses for the white people of Savannah. As the years ticked by, the community there had to endure a number of darker events, moments of tragedy that left bruises on the city&#x2019;s history. And the first of those happened in 1796.<br><br>That was the year that a fire broke out in the bakery owned by one Mr. Grommet. On the evening of November 26, a fire started in his unoccupied shop and then moved to neighboring structures. Thanks to a two-month-long drought and an inadequate fire service, the blaze spread quickly and eventually destroyed over two hundred homes and 150 other buildings&#x2014;roughly one-third of the entire city.<br><br>Another fire occurred in January 1820, destroying nearly five hundred buildings and leaving two-thirds of the city&#x2019;s inhabitants completely homeless. Later that year, while so many people were outdoors rebuilding their homes, heavy rain and hot weather led to a perfect breeding ground for mosquitos, which began the spread of yellow fever. By the time it finally ran its course, the epidemic had claimed nearly seven hundred lives, more than 20 percent of the city&#x2019;s population. It was described by one witness as a &#x201c;scene of sickness, misery and ruin.&#x201d;<br><br>Forty years later, after capturing Atlanta in September 1864, Union General William Tecumseh Sherman led sixty-two thousand soldiers south toward Savannah. Less than a month after their arrival, the city fell. And while the city was spared the destruction that Sherman had built a reputation for, smaller battles around the city took hundreds of lives. Five months later, the war was over.<br><br>A decade after that, yellow fever returned, moving across the city like a tidal wave and taking another thousand lives with it. There are rumors that city officials hid many of the bodies in underground tunnels beneath the former Candler Hospital in an effort to hide the severity of the outbreak. While those stories can&#x2019;t be entirely validated, we do know those same tunnels were once used by the hospital for autopsies.<br><br>Everywhere you go in Savannah, it seems there&#x2019;s a bit of history lurking in the background. It&#x2019;s an ancient city, at least by American standards, and you can feel it in the genteel pre&#x2013;Civil War architecture. Just take a walk along historic River Street, past the centuries-old warehouses that now play host to taverns, hotels, and boutiques, and you&#x2019;ll see what I mean. It&#x2019;s beautiful, in a haunting sort of way.<br><br>There&#x2019;s something else, though. Something lurking at the edges like a shadowy figure, waiting to reveal itself. Maybe it&#x2019;s the gloom of those shady squares, or the tangle of Spanish moss that hangs off so many of the trees like the web of some unnatural spider. Savannah has just as much darkness as it does beauty.<br><br>And then, of course, there are the ghosts.<br><br>Dueling Fates<br><br>I&#x2019;m going to be honest with you: James Stark was a bit of a jerk. On the surface, he was everything you would expect from a southern gentleman in 1830. He was young, rich, and quite fond of climbing the social ladder. But like I said, he wasn&#x2019;t the nicest of people.<br><br>He seemed to have a problem with another of the men in his circle, Philip Minis. That&#x2019;s because, while Stark was descended from English plantation owners, Minis was the son of the first Jewish settlers in the area. So Stark, believing that someone&#x2019;s ancestry somehow made them inferior, used every opportunity he could find to mock and insult poor Minis.<br><br>In the spring of 1832, this apparently led to a confrontation between the two of them. One version of the legend says that the pair had been playing a game of horseshoes and that Stark became angry when Minis beat him. Stark called the other man some derogatory and racially based names, and Minis demanded an apology. Stark refused, and instead offered a different solution: they should settle it with a duel.<br><br>Minis agreed, and both parties began to prepare for the appointed day. Except something came up and Minis couldn&#x2019;t make it. He told Stark, but his request for a delay was ignored. So on the day of the duel, Stark arrived in his finest coat and pulled out an ornate and expensive dueling pistol. After waiting for a while for his opponent to arrive, he simply fired it into the air, and then declared Philip Minis a coward.<br><br>But you can&#x2019;t do something like that without word spreading, and eventually Minis caught wind of what had happened. Naturally, he was outraged, and went looking for Stark. According to the story, he tracked him down to the City Hotel, and on August 10, 1832, he made his way there, took a seat at the bar, and had one of the staff take a message up to Stark&#x2019;s room. And then . . . he waited.<br><br>A few minutes later, Stark descended the stairs, and locked eyes with Minis. There was a moment of intense, palpable tension, and then Philip Minis shouted across the room, &#x201c;I pronounce you, James Stark, a coward!&#x201d;<br><br>Both men reached for their pistols, but Minis was faster. He fired just once, and Stark toppled over, landing at the foot of the stairs in a puddle of his own blood. He never stood back up.<br><br>After a short trial that ended in his acquittal, Minis moved north to Maryland, where he served as a physician to the Native Americans in the Baltimore area, and died there decades later of natural causes. James Stark, though, seems to have never left the City Hotel. The building later became a hospital and is now home to a brewery, and sightings of his ghost there are as common as the sweet smell of beer.<br><br>Eight years after that fateful duel, architect Charles Cluskey was supervising the final touches on an enormous 16,000-square-foot mansion at the intersection of Bull and Harris Streets. The owner was a wealthy shipping merchant who had moved there from Haiti, where his family had long owned a large and profitable plantation. Judging by how many secrets he had to hide, he was going to need every single spare room in that house.<br><br>For starters, he had moved to Savannah at a time when there were more slaves in the city than white European Americans. That social divide was ever-present, like a cultural Grand Canyon, and people were very good at maintaining the status quo. Which presented a challenge to Fran�ois Sorrel des Rivi�res, because in addition to speaking French, he had the blood of African slaves in his veins.<br><br>After moving to Savannah in 1812, Fran�ois transformed himself. He learned to speak perfect English, changed his name to Francis Sorrel, and pushed his ancestry deep into the dark. And it seems to have worked, however tragic it is that he had to do that at all.<br><br>His first wife, Lucinda, passed away from yellow fever in 1817, leaving him alone with three children. He married again two years later to a woman named Matilda, and they went on to have eight children of their own. Together, the family filled that mansion with laughter and noise and . . . well . . . more secrets, apparently.<br><br>Matilda was said to struggle with severe depression, and would often stay in bed for days or weeks at a time. Her needs, along with those of Francis and the children, were all taken care of, though, because the family, in a textbook example of irony, actually owned a large number of slaves.<br><br>One of those slaves, according to the legend, was a young woman named Molly, whose beauty caught the eye of Francis. So much so that he carried on an affair with her, right under the same roof as his wife. It was bold, and&#x2014;if history has taught us anything about slave owners and the way they treated the women they owned&#x2014;it was also probably against Molly&#x2019;s consent.<br><br>This went on for some time, until one day Matilda opened a door to one of the bedrooms, only to find Francis in bed with Molly. It&#x2019;s said that the discovery was so shocking that Matilda ran back to her own bedroom, threw open the balcony doors, and jumped out. She died where she landed on the street below. A few days later, Molly ended her own life in the carriage house.<br><br>With a past that bloody, it&#x2019;s no wonder that for many decades visitors to the house have claimed to experience unusual phenomena. Tourists have reported being touched by unseen hands, or feeling the pain of being struck by an invisible force. Others have described shadowy figures that move across hallways, and the sounds of voices crying out from different parts of the house. If these stories are true, the house might be unoccupied, but it&#x2019;s certainly not empty.<br><br>Whether or not the reports are true, this series of events is far from the darkest tale to have come out of Savannah. The city&#x2019;s past is checkered with moments of violence and evil, and it&#x2019;s easy to get lost in the shadows. But the most tragic story of all happened just two years after the city was founded.<br><br>It seems that the first settlers of Savannah brought more than hope to the New World; they also brought death.<br><br>Bound and Gagged<br><br>Oglethorpe had a lofty goal for the colony of Georgia. On the surface, it seemed like a great opportunity: either you could stay in jail for the debts you might never be able to pay back, or you could board a ship and travel to the New World and make a fresh start. You just had to work hard and be willing to take up arms if there was a need. To get the word out, Oglethorpe used agents in England and Ireland to recruit new settlers. As you would expect, the terms were spelled out clearly to these candidates.<br><br>Except you know how tricky contracts can be, right? Phrases that sound good on the surface but hide a catch or a trap that you don&#x2019;t notice. This was indentured servitude, sometimes called debt bondage, because once you agreed to the deal, you were barely better off than a slave for the next seven years.</p><h2>NABRE - New American Bible Revised Edition (Red Premium Ultrasoft)</h2><p>Saint Benedict Press is a proud publisher of the New American Bible Revised Edition (NABRE), the first major update to the New American Bible (NAB) text in twenty years.<br><br> Reflecting the work of nearly 100 scholars and extensively reviewed and approved by the USCCB, the NABRE takes into account the best current scholarship as well as the new discovery of ancient manuscripts that improve our knowledge and understanding of the Biblical text.<br><br> With it's extensive notes, commentary, and cross-references, the NABRE will promote a deeper love and understanding of Scripture in the home, parish and school.

No one knew why Aprile, the last great American Don, had adopted Astorre Viola many years before in Sicily; no one suspected how he had carefully trained him . . . and how, while the Don's children claimed respectable careers in America, Astorre Viola waited for his time to come.<br><br>Now his time has arrived. The Don is dead, his murder one bloody act in a drama of ambition and deceit--from the deadly compromises made by an FBI agent to the greed of two crooked NYPD detectives and the frightening plans of a South American mob kingpin. In a collision of enemies and lovers, betrayers and loyal soldiers, Astorre Viola will claim his destiny. Because after all these years, this moment is in his blood. . . .</p><p><i>Omerta</i>, the third novel in Mario Puzo's Mafia trilogy, is infinitely better than the third <i>Godfather</i> film, and most movies in fact. Besides colorful characters and snappy dialogue, it's got a knotty, gratifying, just-complex-enough plot and plenty of movie-like scenes. The newly retired Mafioso Don Raymonde Aprile attends his grandson's confirmation at St. Patrick's in New York, handing each kid a gold coin. Long shot: "Brilliant sunshine etched the image of that great cathedral into the streets around it." Medium shot: "The girls in frail cobwebby white lace dresses, the boys [with] traditional red neckties knitted at their throats to ward off the Devil." Close-up: "The first bullet hit the Don square in the forehead. The second bullet tore out his throat."<p> More crucial than the tersely described violence is the emotional setting: a traditional, loving clan menaced by traditional vendettas. With Don Aprile hit, the family's fate lies in the strong hands of his adopted nephew from Sicily, Astorre. The Don kept his own kids sheltered from the Mafia: one son is an army officer; another is a TV exec; his daughter Nicole (the most developed character of the three) is an ace lawyer who liked to debate the Don on the death penalty. "Mercy is a vice, a pretension to powers we do not have ... an unpardonable offense to the victim," the Don maintained. Astorre, a macaroni importer and affable amateur singer, was secretly trained to carry on the Don's work. Now his job is to show no mercy.</p><p> But who did the hit? Was it Kurt Cilke, the morally tormented FBI man who recently jailed most of the Mafia bosses? Or Timmona Portella, the Mob boss Cilke still wants to collar? How about Marriano Rubio, the womanizing, epicurean Peruvian diplomat who wants Nicole in bed--did he also want her papa's head? </p><p> If you didn't know Puzo wrote <i>Omerta</i>, it would be no mystery. His marks are all over it: lean prose, a romance with the Old Country, a taste for olives in barrels, a jaunty cynicism ("You cannot send six billionaires to prison," says Cilke's boss. "Not in a democracy"), an affection for characters with flawed hearts, like Rudolfo the $1,500-an-hour sexual massage therapist, or his short-tempered client Aspinella, the one-eyed NYPD detective. The simultaneous courtship of cheery Mafia tramp Rosie by identical hit-man twins Frankie and Stace Sturzo makes you fall in love with them all--and feel a genuine pang when blood proves thicker than eros. </p><p> This fitting capstone to Puzo's career is optioned for a film, and Michael Imperioli of TV's <i>The Sopranos</i> narrates the audiocassette version of the novel. But why wait for the movie? <i>Omerta</i> is a big, old-fashioned movie in its own right. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Infonomics: How to Monetize, Manage, and Measure Information as an Asset for Competitive Advantage</h2><p>The discipline of <i>infonomics </i>takes you beyond thinking and talking about information as an asset to actually valuing and treating it as one. One of CIO Magazine's top five "must read" books of the year,&nbsp;<b>Infonomics</b>&nbsp;provides the foundation and methods for quantifying information asset value and tactics for using information as your competitive edge to drive growth.</p><p><b>Why a Book on Infonomics?</b><br>Many people have inquired about what compelled me to write a book about infonomics. Moreover, what kind of crazy person decides to write a book in his "spare time" while in a job demanding much more than bankers' hours?<br>The short answer is that it's been germinating inside me for many years, and kind of bursting to get out. (Yes, much like in the Alien films.) Back in 1999, I casually and kind of tongue-in-cheek coined the "infonomics" term in a META Group research piece, before META was acquired by Gartner, and even before the first incredible Freakonomics book. It took a couple years for me to realize that information isn't formally valued, recognized or reported as an economic asset. From that moment onward, I was on a mission! And for the past couple decades I have been researching, working with clients, developing ideas, and writing articles on this topic among others.<br>After compiling 3000 articles, papers and ideas in an Evernote folder on the topic of valuing, accounting for, and administering various kinds of assets, and having amassed over 300 examples of organizations monetizing information, it seemed &nbsp;high time to write a book. Thankfully Gartner has provided me with the ideal platform, surrounding me with dozens of brilliant colleagues and hundreds of enthusiastic clients over the years with whom to further explore and develop the infonomics concept. But being either too busy or too lazy (more likely both) to write three separate books on monetizing, managing, and measuring information as an asset, it's packed it all into a single book. Feel free however to digest it as three separate books, focusing on one part or another, depending upon your role and interests.<br>What do I hope to achieve from writing the book? In short, it would be great to affect some kind of awakening that provokes further economic expansion at the hands of a growing cadre of infosavvy leaders and their companies. The book isn't about me nor about achieving fame and fortune. (Most Gartner analysts already have all the tech industry notoriety we can handle. And the book is a Gartner book, so no monetization for me no matter how well it sells.) Rather, day in and day out we Gartner analysts speak with clients who are struggling to manage their data better and do more with it. Their organizations put incredible discipline and resources into the handling and leveraging of other business assets, but not so much with their information. <br><br>So if there's one question (maybe two) that I would like the book to evoke from business, technology and information leaders, it's this:<br><b>Why hasn't our organization been treating information as an asset all along, and how the heck can we hope to thrive, let alone survive, in an increasingly digital world without doing so???</b><br>It would be great to see many of you in any of these roles take some of the ideas from the book on just how to do so, implement them, and build on them.<br>Perhaps the book brings about a revolution of sorts, leading to the recognition of information as an accounting asset, and subject to the same legal treatment as other forms of property. Or maybe the book will compel some bright young economist to expand upon and develop infonomics into a new branch of economics, earning herself a Nobel Prize. But accounting regulations and the field of economics are not really my main concern. More than anything, I'm anxious to see how organizations that internally embrace and execute on these ideas and practices become tomorrow's economic powerhouses.<br>So I hope you and your organization's other business leaders, technology, data and analytics leaders, and architects (at least) get the book. And that you each find it interesting, informative, and instructive. Or at least one of the above. :-)<br>Thanks,Doug<br>Follow me on Twitter @Doug_Laney #infonomics #GartnerDA. And check out my blog on the Gartner &nbsp;Blog Network.Many senior executives talk about information as one of their most important assets, but few behave as if it is. They report to the board on the health of their workforce, their financials, their customers, and their partnerships, but rarely the health of their information assets. Corporations typically exhibit greater discipline in tracking and accounting for their office furniture than their data.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Infonomics</i> is the theory, study, and discipline of asserting economic significance to information. It strives to apply both economic and asset management principles and practices to the valuation, handling, and deployment of information assets. This book specifically shows:<ul><li>CEOs and business leaders how to more fully wield information as a corporate asset</li><li>CIOs how to improve the flow and accessibility of information</li><li>CFOs how to help their organizations measure the actual and latent value in their information assets.</li></ul>More directly, this book is for the burgeoning force of Chief Data Officers (CDOs) and other information and analytics leaders in their valiant struggle to help their organizations become more infosavvy.<br>Author Doug Laney has spent years researching and developing Infonomics and advising organizations on the infinite opportunities to monetize, manage, and measure information. This book delivers a set of new ideas, frameworks, evidence, and even approaches adapted from other disciplines on how to administer, wield, and understand the value of information. Infonomics can help organizations not only to better develop, sell, and market their offerings, but to transform their organizations altogether.</p><h2>Goldmining the Shadows</h2><p>Pain is something we can all relate to. We have grown socially accustomed to looking for a magic pill to mask it, and all other symptoms of deeper unrest. Yet becoming intimate with pain, but not possessed by it, enables us to feel, sense, and hear the wise teachings held within it. Emotional, physical, mental, sexual, and psychic pain, as well as collective pain carried for Earth during this time of great transition, contains valuable wisdom.Shadow is a term for the discarded within ourselves that informs our lives. It offers the potential to reveal what we previously thought was unsuitable, so unsuitable that we imprisoned it and forgot it. The aim is to know the shadow well, appreciate it, seek to integrate it&#x2014;not leave it neglected to rot in a cell beneath the surface, where it is inevitably clanging its tin cup against the bars asking for acknowledgement and honoring&#x2014;to make a place for it as part of your life story, but not let it be the operating manual.In this book, we'll explore:The keys to working with your shadowsHow to engage your shadow to heal generational patternsThe acts of liberation for individuals and all members of society and cultureWhat it would look like to break the repetitive loop of sufferingLanguage prompts to help navigate the shadowsShadow work is one of many keys to breaking the cycles of suffering.

Profoundly inspiring, it is at the same time vastly entertaining, warmly humorous and filled with extraordinary personages.<p>Self-Realization Fellowship's editions, and none others, include extensive material added by the author after the first edition was published, including a final chapter on the closing years of his life.</p><p>Selected as "One of the 100 Best Spiritual Books of the Twentieth Century", <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> has been translated into more than 30 languages, and is regarded worldwide as a classic of religious literature. Several million copies have been sold, and it continues to appear on best-seller lists after more than sixty consecutive years in print. </p><p> With engaging candor, eloquence, and wit, Paramahansa Yogananda tells the inspiring chronicle of his life: the experiences of his remarkable childhood, encounters with many saints and sages during his youthful search throughout India for an illumined teacher, ten years of training in the hermitage of a revered yoga master, and the thirty years that he lived and taught in America. Also recorded here are his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Burbank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other celebrated spiritual personalities of East and West. The author clearly explains the subtle but definite laws behind both the ordinary events of everyday life and the extraordinary events commonly termed miracles. His absorbing life story becomes the background for a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence.</p></p><p>Autobiography of a Yogi (1946 Edition)By W. Y. Evans-Wentz, M.A., D.Litt., D.Sc. <p>Jesus College, Oxford; Author of The Tibetan Book of the Dead, Tibet's Great Yogi Milarepa, Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines, etc. </p><p>The value of Yogananda's Autobiography is greatly enhanced by the fact that it is one of the few books in English about the wise men of India which has been written, not by a journalist or foreigner, but by one of their own race and training--in short, a book about yogis by a yogi. As an eyewitness recountal of the extraordinary lives and powers of modern Hindu saints, the book has importance both timely and timeless. To its illustrious author, whom I have had the pleasure of knowing both in India and America, may every reader render due appreciation and gratitude. His unusual life-document is certainly one of the most revealing of the depths of the Hindu mind and heart, and of the spiritual wealth of India, ever to be published in the West. </p><p>It has been my privilege to have met one of the sages whose life-history is herein narrated-Sri Yukteswar Giri. A likeness of the venerable saint appeared as part of the frontispiece of my Tibetan Yoga and Secret Doctrines*(1). It was at Puri, in Orissa, on the Bay of Bengal, that I encountered Sri Yukteswar. He was then the head of a quiet ashrama near the seashore there, and was chiefly occupied in the spiritual training of a group of youthful disciples. He expressed keen interest in the welfare of the people of the United States and of all the Americas, and of England, too, and questioned me concerning the distant activities, particularly those in California, of his chief disciple, Paramhansa Yogananda, whom he dearly loved, and whom he had sent, in 1920, as his emissary to the West. </p><p>Sri Yukteswar was of gentle mien and voice, of pleasing presence, and worthy of the veneration which his followers spontaneously accorded to him. Every person who knew him, whether of his own community or not, held him in the highest esteem. I vividly recall his tall, straight, ascetic figure, garbed in the saffron-colored garb of one who has renounced worldly quests, as he stood at the entrance of the hermitage to give me welcome. His hair was long and somewhat curly, and his face bearded. His body was muscularly firm, but slender and well-formed, and his step energetic. He had chosen as his place of earthly abode the holy city of Puri, whither multitudes of pious Hindus, representative of every province of India, come daily on pilgrimage to the famed Temple of Jagannath, "Lord of the World." It was at Puri that Sri Yukteswar closed his mortal eyes, in 1936, to the scenes of this transitory state of being and passed on, knowing that his incarnation had been carried to a triumphant completion. </p><p>I am glad, indeed, to be able to record this testimony to the high character and holiness of Sri Yukteswar. Content to remain afar from the multitude, he gave himself unreservedly and in tranquillity to that ideal life which Paramhansa Yogananda, his disciple, has now described for the ages W. Y.

T.R. Fehrenbach traces the Comanches&#x2019; rise to power, from their prehistoric origins to their domination of the high plains for more than a century until their demise in the face of Anglo-American expansion.<br><br> Master horseback riders who lived in teepees and hunted bison, the Comanches were stunning orators, disciplined warriors, and the finest makers of arrows. They lived by a strict legal code and worshipped within a cosmology of magic. As he portrays the Comanche lifestyle, Fehrenbach re-creates their doomed battle against European encroachment. While they destroyed the Spanish dream of colonizing North America and blocked the French advance into the Southwest, the Comanches ultimately fell before the Texas Rangers and the U.S. Army in the great raids and battles of the mid-nineteenth century. This is a classic American story, vividly and poignantly told.</p><p>&#x201c;For a complete history of the Comanches, this book probably has no equal.&#x201d; &#x2013;Dee Brown, author of <b>Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a very good book.

What was it that enabled him to stand so steadfastly when all those around him seemed to turn back in fear? What was it that enabled him to inspire whole nations to endure the unendurable and to achieve the unachievable when all those around him had already surrendered all hope? This remarkable new study of Churchill&#39;s leadership skill answers these questions and more. The result is an account that is as inspiring today as it was more than half a century ago when the great man&#39; shadow fell large across the world stage. According to Henry Kissinger, Our age finds it difficult to come to grips with Churchill. The political leaders with whom we are familiar generally aspire to be superstars rather than heroes. The distinction is crucial. Superstars strive for approbation; heroes walk alone. Superstars crave consensus; heroes define themselves by the...future they see it as their risk to bring about. Superstars seek success in a technique for eliciting support; heroes pursue success as the outgrowth of their inner values. Winston Churchill was a hero.</p><p></p><h2>San Francisco Noir: Photographs by Fred Lyon (San Francisco Photography Book in Black and White Film Noir Style)</h2><p>Following in the footsteps of classic films like The Maltese Falcon and The Lady from Shanghai, veteran photographer Fred Lyon creates images of San Francisco in high contrast with a sense of mystery. In this latest offering from the photographer of <em>San Francisco: Portrait of a City 1940&#x2013;1960</em>, Lyon presents a darker tone, exploring the hidden corners of his native city. Images taken in the foggy night are illuminated only by neon signs, classic car headlights, apartment windows, or streetlights. Sharply dressed couples stroll out for evening shows, drivers travel down steep hills, and sailors work through the night at the old Fisherman's Wharf. Stylistically, many of the photographs are experimental the noir tone is enhanced by double exposures, elements of collage, and blurred motion. These strikingly evocative duotone images expose a view of San Francisco as only Fred Lyon could capture.<br></p><p>Fred Lyon studied under famed photographer Ansel Adams and has been called "San Francisco's Brassai." A lifelong resident of San Francisco, he has contributed to numerous fashion, home, and garden magazines. His work has been exhibited in San Francisco at the Museum of Modern Art, the Legion of Honor Museum, and the Leica Gallery, as well as the Art Institute of Chicago, and was the subject of a <em>Life</em> magazine retrospective."Before San Francisco was synonymous with tech money and progressive politics, there were other versions of the city. The version that Fred Lyon celebrates in his new book is a classic-San Francisco full of smoky jazz clubs, neon lights in the fog and sharply dressed men and women stepping on and off of trolley cars. Made mostly during the 1950s and '60s, Lyon's images are big on atmosphere and style, and hit many parts of the city that visitors love."<br> - Photo District News<br><br>"Those under San Francisco's spell become enthralled by its dynamic light and character: sparkling, or fog shrouded, or shadowy and mysterious, depending on time and season. Photographer Lyon is no outsider to the city. He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan and has photographed it for decades, obsessively roaming its vertiginous streets. Most of these velvety black-and-white images were taken in the 1940s and 1950s, a lost era of pillbox hats, fedoras, neon signs, stevedores, and a real fishermen's wharf. In addition to the exteriors, Lyon made vivid, up-close portraits of jazz musicians in live performance at classic long-gone venues such as Basin Street West and the Black Hawk... the glossy paper, attractive printing, and black cloth-bound cover with silver lettering make an attractive package. A brief introduction by journalist and author Ernest Beyl describes Lyon's lifelong passion for his native city. VERDICT A wonderful browse that invites armchair time travelers to experience a bygone era." <br> - Library Journal<br><br>"No photographer has better captured the allure of San Francisco in all its foggy, cinematic splendor than Lyon, the fourth-generation San Franciscan who is now 93. His latest book assembles 200 black-and-white images of what is largely a lost world of jazz clubs, seedy streets and everyday working-class life."<br> - San Francisco Chronicle<br><br>"Fred Lyon captured misty, melancholy San Francisco over a period of 75 years, and the results are absolutely captivating. [...] The beautiful photo-book, which is bound in sumptuous dark blue cloth, comprises Lyon's photographs of the hilly city taken over 75 years..Each photograph in San Francisco Noir boasts a singular allure, and a distinct ability to transport the viewer to Lyon's city's bygone era - a brand of gloomy-yet-delightful escapism that is a most enjoyable way to start off a mundane week." <br> - AnOther Magazine</p><h2>The Story of Jumping Mouse: A Caldecott Honor Award Winner</h2><p><p>"You will reach the far-off land if you keep hope alive within you."

She lives with her husband and two children in Bristol, Tennessee.Eleven-year-old Isabelle, a third-generation lace maker, is making her first delivery to the Palace of Versailles when she is nearly trampled by a crowd. Astonishingly, it's Marie Antoinette who rescues her, and the queen invites Isabelle to meet Princess Marie-Therese, who chooses Isabelle to be her friend. So begins Isabelle's double life--a lace maker in the morning and royal companion in the afternoon. As the French Revolution brews outside the palace, Isabelle begins to challenge the conventional wisdom that God ordains the social order, even as she staunchly disagrees with accusations leveled against the royal family. Skillfully integrated historical facts frame this engrossing, believable story. Readers will be captivated by the child's view of Versailles, its glittering halls infested with rats; the drudgery of daily work; and the terrors of the French Revolution. The unlikely, fragile friendship that crosses class boundaries will speak straight to young readers' own concerns. An appended author's note gives more historical context and addresses possible complaints that Isabelle's first meeting with the queen is a plot contrivance. <i>Gillian Engberg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The beliefs of Founders such as Patrick Henry, John Quincy Adams, John Jay, George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, John Adams, George Mason, and many others are clearly presented. America&#39;s Godly Heritage also provides excerpts from court cases showing that for 160 years under the Constitution, Christian principles were officially and legally inseparable from American public life. The DVD by the same title graphically displays statistics showing what has happened to America since the courts have begun rejecting the Founders&#39; beliefs. This book is an excellent primer for those who want to know more about what was intended for America by the Founders and what can be done to return America to its original guiding philosophy. It&#39;s ideal to share with home gatherings, church groups, and Sunday school classes, or to use as a history supplement for children or schools.</p><p>David Barton is the founder of WallBuilders, an organization dedicated to presenting America&#39;s forgotten history and heroes, with an emphasis on our moral, religious, and constitutional heritage.

One of the great advantages of knitting and crochet is that you can carry your work anywhere you go. Both construct a fabric from interlocking loops of yarn rather than woven threads on a loom.</p><p>There is a certain satisfaction watching the fabric take shape as you progress&#x2014;no paper patterns or cutting out&#x2014;all you have to do at the end is seam the pieces together. Of course, there are certain methods and techniques that a knitter needs to master before his or her creativity can really take flight.</p><p><i>Knitting &amp; Crochet</i> covers all the basics, with step-by-step illustrations to guide you, sections on equipment, how to read printed patterns, four simple projects and a glossary. Whether you are creating unique clothes and accessories for your family or you are making items for a charity, there is a particular pleasure to be had from making things by hand with the ancient crafts of knitting and crochet.</p></p><p><p><b>Knitting &amp; Crochet</b></p><p>Hand knitting and its sister craft of crochet have always been popular pastimes. Engaging, creative and rewarding in equal measure, they also offer the benefits of saving the pennies and adding a personal touch to gifts and garments. With simple instructions and step-by-step illustrations, this practical handbook will equip you with all the know-how you need to create your own clothes, toys and decorations with little more than a ball of yarn and a pair of knitting needles.</p><p>The <i>Craft Workbook</i> series has been created with the absolute beginner in mind as well as those who would welcome a refresher in the most popular needlecrafts.

Matt lives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.1. eavesdropping <p> </p><p> Lucky Trimble crouched in a wedge of shade behind the Dumpster. Her ear near a hole in the paint-chipped wall of Hard Pan's Found Object Wind Chime Museum and Visitor Center, she listened as Short Sammy told the story of how he hit rock bottom. How he quit drinking and found his Higher Power. Short Sammy's story, of all the rock-bottom stories Lucky had heard at twelve-step anonymous meetings -- alcoholics, gamblers, smokers, and overeaters -- was still her favorite. </p><p> Sammy told of the day when he had drunk half a gallon of rum listening to Johnny Cash all morning in his parked '62 Cadillac, then fallen out of the car when he saw a rattlesnake on the passenger seat biting his dog, Roy, on the scrotum. </p><p> Lucky balanced herself with a hand above the little hole that Short Sammy's voice was coming out of. With her other hand, she lifted the way-too-curly hair off her neck. She noticed two small black birds nearby, panting like dogs from the heat, their beaks open, their feathers puffed up. She put her ear to the hole because Sammy's voice always got low and soft when he came to the tragical end of the story. </p><p> But Short Sammy didn't head right to the good part. To stretch it out and get more suspense going for the big ending, he veered off and told about the old days when he was broke and couldn't afford to buy rum, so he made homemade liquor from cereal box raisins and any kind of fruit he could scrounge up. This was the usual roundabout way he talked, and Lucky had noticed that it made people stay interested, even if the story got quite a bit longer than if someone else had been telling it. </p><p> She stood up, her neck and the backs of her knees sweating, and mashed wads of hair up under the edges of her floppy hat. She carefully angled an old lawn chair with frayed webbing into her wedge of shade, and made sure the chair wouldn't break by easing herself onto it. Flies came, the little biting ones; she fanned them away with her plastic dustpan. Heat blasted off the Dumpster. </p><p> There was a little silence, except for the wobbly ticking noise of the ceiling fan inside and people shifting in their folding metal chairs. She was pretty sure they had already heard the story of Short Sammy hitting rock bottom before, as she had, and that they loved the pure glory and splendiferousness of it as much as she did -- even though it was hard to imagine Short Sammy being drunk. Short Sammy's voice sounded like it could barely stand to say what came next. </p><p> "That Roy, man," said Sammy, who called everyone "man," even people like Lucky who were not men. "He was one brave dog. He killed that snake even though it bit him in the place where it hurts the worst for a male. And there I am, trying to get away, falling out of the Cad. I break a tooth, I cut my cheek, I give myself a black eye, I even sprain my ankle, but I'm so drunk, man, I don't even know I'm messed up -- not till much later. Then I pass out. </p><p> "Next day I wake up on the ground, sand in my mouth, and it feels like death. I mean, it's like I <i>died,</i> man, but at the same time, like I'm too sick and ashamed to be dead. There's a mangled rattlesnake under the car, there's blood, lots of blood -- I don't even know if it's my blood or Roy's or the snake's. Roy's gone. I call him -- nothing. I figure maybe after saving my stupid life he went off to die alone somewhere. It's probably like a hundred degrees in the shade, man, about as hot as it is now, but I'm so cold I can't stop shivering." </p><p> Lucky's hands smelled metallic, like the thin arms of the lawn chair; they felt sticky. She pushed her hat back from her forehead; air cooled the sweat there. </p><p> "I make this deal with myself," Sammy continued. "The deal is if Roy is okay I'll quit drinking, join AA, get clean." </p><p> Lucky edged her bare leg away from a rough, poking strand of chair webbing. Each time Short Sammy came to this part in his story, Lucky thought of what kind of deal she would make with herself if she hit rock bottom. Like, let's say she didn't know if her dog, HMS Beagle, was alive or dead; she would have to do something really hard and drastic as her end of the bargain. Or, let's say that her Guardian just gave up and quit because Lucky did something terrible. The difference between a Guardian and an actual mom is that a mom can't resign. A mom has the job for life. But a Guardian like Brigitte could probably just say, "Well, that's about it for <i>this</i> job. I'm going back to France now. <i>Au revoir."</i> There poor Lucky would be, standing alone in the kitchen trailer, at rock bottom. Then she would have to search for her own Higher Power and do a fearless and searching moral inventory of herself, just like Short Sammy and all the other anonymous people had had to do. </p><p> Short Sammy went on, "Then my wife drives up. Man, I didn't even know she'd gone. I'm still kind of laying there on the ground. She gets out of her car, but she doesn't say one word about how messed up I am. </p><p> "All she says is, 'I took Roy to the vet's in Sierra City.' She's talking real calm, almost like she's not mad or anything. She says, 'Fifty miles from here, and I drove it in, like, maybe half an hour. That was the worst drive of my life, Sammy, thanks to you. But Roy's okay because I got him there in time for the antivenom to work.' </p><p> "Then she goes into the house and comes out with her suitcases that she must have packed the night before, and Roy's food dish and water bowl. <i>That</i> killed me, her taking his food dish and water bowl. All she says to me is, 'Don't call me.' That, man, was rock bottom. So I threw down the shovel. And here I am." </p><p> There was clapping, and Lucky knew that pretty soon they would pass a hat around for people to put money in. It was a little disappointing that today nobody had explained how exactly they had found their Higher Power, which was what Lucky was mainly interested in finding out about. </p><p> She didn't get why finding it was so <i>hard.</i> The anonymous people often talked about getting control of their lives through their Higher Power. Being ten and a half, Lucky felt like she had no control over her life -- partly because she wasn't grown up yet -- but that if she found her Higher Power it would guide her in the right direction. </p><p> Chairs scraped as everyone stood up. Now they would all say a little prayer together, which Lucky liked because there was no church or synagogue or anything in Hard Pan, California, so the Found Object Wind Chime Museum and Visitor Center was the closest they got to one. That meant the end of the meeting and time for her to disappear quick. She'd finished her job of clearing trash from the patio in front -- smashed beer cans and candy wrappers from yesterday's Gamblers Anonymous meeting. It wasn't likely that anyone would be coming back to the Dumpster behind the museum, but someone <i>might.</i> She had to hurry, but she had to hurry <i>slowly,</i> in order not to make a sound. </p><p> She stashed her dustpan and rake beside the wall and left the aluminum lawn chair hidden behind the Dumpster. Tomorrow, Saturday, would be her day off. Then on Sunday afternoon, before the Smokers Anonymous meeting, she would again clean up the museum's little patio. The patio was where the anonymous people sat around talking after their meetings. All the anonymous people left lots of litter, and each group could not bear to see the butts or the cans or the candy wrappers of the group that met before it. The reason was that they were in recovery. The recovering alcoholics hated to see or smell beer cans left by the recovering smokers and gamblers; the recovering smokers could not stand cigarette butts left by the recovering drinkers, and the recovering overeaters hated to see candy wrappers left by the recovering drinkers, smokers, and gamblers.Which meant that Lucky had a job -- a great job -- and except for Dot's kitchen-and-back-porch Baubles 'n' Beauty Salon and the Captain's mail-sorting job at the post office, it was the only <i>paying</i> job in town. </p><p> Wrestling with the straps of her survival kit backpack, which she had with her at all times, then jogging down the dry streambed toward home, Lucky thought of a question that Short Sammy's story had lodged into one of her brain crevices. She figured she had so <i>many</i> crevices and wrinkles, almost all of them filled with questions and anxious thoughts, that if you were to take her brain and flatten it out, it would cover a huge space, like maybe a king-size bed. </p><p> The question of Short Sammy's dog's scrotum settled into one certain brain crevice as she picked her way among the weedy bushes of the dry wash. Even though Lucky could ask Short Sammy almost anything and he wouldn't mind, she could never ask about the story of Roy, since she had overheard it. If she asked about Roy, then he would know that she'd been eavesdropping at the anonymous twelve-step meetings. </p><p> Scrotum sounded to Lucky like something green that comes up when you have the flu and cough too much. It sounded medical and secret, but also important, and Lucky was glad she was a girl and would never have such an aspect as a scrotum to her own body. Deep inside she thought she <i>would</i> be interested in <i>seeing</i> an actual scrotum. But at the same time -- and this is where Lucky's brain was very complicated -- she definitely did not want to see one. </p><p> A little breeze had come up by the time she got home to the half circle of trailers. First was her little shiny aluminum canned-ham trailer, where she and HMS Beagle slept. Next, the long kitchen-dining room-bathroom trailer, and last, Brigitte's Westcraft bedroom trailer. Instead of having wheels and being hooked up to cars to tow them around, the three trailers were mounted on concrete blocks; plus they were anchored to the ground with metal cables to keep from being blown over in windstorms. The best part was that you could walk from Lucky's canned ham to Brigitte's Westcraft without ever going outside, because passageways had been cut where the trailers' ends touched, and sheets of metal had been shaped and s...</p></p><h2>Fifty Freakin&#39; Years Of The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers</h2><p>Yes!!

Hart believed that in the intervening years the influence of some of his original selections had grown or lessened and that new names loomed large on the world stage. Thus, the publications of this revised and updated edition of The 100.<br><br>As before, Hart's yardstick is influence: not the greatest people, but the most influential, the people who swayed the destinies of millions of human beings, determined the rise and fall of civilizations, changed the course of history. With incisive biographies, Hart describes their careers and contributions. Explaining his ratings, he presents a new perspective on history, gathering together the vital facts about the world's greatest religious and political leaders, inventors, writers, philosophers, explorers, artists, and innovators&#x2014;from Asoka to Zoroaster. Most of the biographies are accompanied by photographs or sketches. Hart's selections may be surprising to some. Neither Jesus nor Marx, but Muhammad, is designated as the most influential person in human history. The writer's arguments may challenge and perhaps convince readers, but whether or not they agree with him, his manner of ranking is both informative and entertaining. <i>The 100</i>, revised and updated, is truly a monumental work. It promises to be just as controversial, just as thought-provoking, and just as successful as its predecessor&#x2014;a perfect addition to any history or philosophy reference section.</p><p><b>Michael H. Hart</b> is an American author and astrophysicist. His first and most famous book, <i>The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History</i>, was published in 1978 and has sold more than half a million copies in 15 languages.</p><h2>What the Dog Knows: Scent, Science, and the Amazing Ways Dogs Perceive the World</h2><p>A firsthand exploration of the extraordinary abilities and surprising, sometimes life-saving talents of &#x201c;working dogs&#x201d;&#x2014;pups who can sniff out drugs, find explosives, even locate the dead&#x2014;as told through the experiences of a journalist and her intrepid canine companion, which <i>The</i> <i>New York Times </i>calls<i> </i>&#x201c;a fascinating, deeply reported journey into the...amazing things dogs can do with their noses.&#x201d;<br><br>There are thousands of working dogs all over the US and beyond with incredible abilities&#x2014;they can find missing people, detect drugs and bombs, pinpoint unmarked graves of Civil War soldiers, or even find drowning victims more than two hundred feet below the surface of a lake. These abilities may seem magical or mysterious, but author Cat Warren shows the science, the rigorous training, and the skilled handling that underlie these creatures&#x2019; amazing abilities. <br> <br>Cat Warren is a university professor and journalist who had tried everything she could think of to harness her dog Solo&#x2019;s boundless energy and enthusiasm...until a behavior coach suggested she try training him to be a &#x201c;working dog.&#x201d; What started out as a hobby soon became a calling, as Warren was introduced to the hidden universe of dogs who do this essential work and the handlers who train them.<br> <br>Her dog Solo has a fine nose and knows how to use it, but he&#x2019;s only one of many astounding dogs in a varied field. Warren interviews cognitive psychologists, historians, medical examiners, epidemiologists, and forensic anthropologists, as well as the breeders, trainers, and handlers who work with and rely on these intelligent and adaptable animals daily. Along the way, Warren discovers story after story that prove the capabilities&#x2014;as well as the very real limits&#x2014;of working dogs and their human partners. Clear-eyed and unsentimental, Warren explains why our partnership with working dogs is woven into the fabric of society, and why we keep finding new uses for the wonderful noses of our four-legged friends.</p><p>Cat Warren is a professor at North Carolina State University, where she teaches science journalism, editing, and creative nonfiction&nbsp;courses. Before starting her academic career, Warren worked for newspapers across the United States, reporting on crime, poverty, and politics, from California to Wyoming to Connecticut. Warren started training her young&nbsp;German shepherd, Solo, as a cadaver dog in 2004. She and Solo were called to search for the missing across North Carolina for a number of years. She lives in downtown Durham, North Carolina, with her husband, David Auerbach, a retired professor of philosophy at North Carolina State University, and their two German shepherds.

A few teeth, a vertebra, a piece of carpet that lay underneath a body. One of my German shepherd&#x2019;s standard training materials is dirt harvested from sites where decomposing bodies rested. Crack open a Mason jar filled with that dirt, and all I smell is North Carolina woods&#x2014;musky darkness with a hint of mildewed alder leaves. Solo smells the departed.<br> <br>Solo is a cadaver dog. I occasionally get a call asking for our services when someone is missing and most likely dead. People have asked me if Solo gets depressed when he finds someone dead. No. Solo&#x2019;s work&#x2014;and his fun&#x2014;begins with someone&#x2019;s ending. Nothing makes him happier than a romp in a swamp looking for someone who has been missing for a while. For him, human death is a big game. To win, all he has to do is smell it, get as close as he can to it, tell me about it, and then get his reward: playing tug-of-war with a rope toy.<br> <br>I never thought death could have an upside. I certainly never expected a dog to point that out to me. Since I started training and working with Solo eight years ago, he&#x2019;s opened a new world to me. Sure, some of it is dark, but gradations of light filter through so much of it that I find it illuminates other spaces in my life.<br> <br>Solo and I have different reasons for doing this work. What appears to motivate him is not just the tug-toy reward at the end (although that pleases him greatly) but also the work itself, as he sweeps a field like a hyperactive Zamboni on ice, tracking will o&#x2019; the wisps of scent down to their source. What motivates me is watching Solo, a black-and-red shepherd with a big grin and a huge rudder of a tail. He captures the hidden world his nose knows and translates that arcane knowledge for us humans. As one of the K9 unit sergeants said, admiring Solo&#x2019;s clear body language, &#x201c;You can read that dog like a book.&#x201d; An easy book, happily, for a working-dog beginner like me. More Dr. Seuss&#x2019;s One Fish Two Fish than James Joyce&#x2019;s Finnegans Wake. It&#x2019;s a good thing that Solo&#x2019;s approach is Seuss-like, because the larger landscape of the missing and dead sometimes keeps me up at night pondering, poking at small details, trying to understand an unknowable plot. As one famous cadaver-dog trainer said, &#x201c;Search is the classic mystery.&#x201d;<br> <br>My hobby can raise eyebrows. While close friends and a few of my university colleagues embraced the idea with delight, others cringed. With some colleagues, I knew better than to mention it. Mostly, they don&#x2019;t know, as there&#x2019;s no reason to. One administrator, surprised when I told him I had to miss an upcoming faculty meeting to take Solo on a last-minute homicide search, came back to me the next day. Perhaps, he suggested with laudable optimism, I could put cadaver-dog work on my curriculum vitae as extension and outreach? I am not sure this peculiar avocation burnishes my academic credentials. I appreciated his willingness to consider it, though. I know cadaver dogs are an esoteric branch off the working-dog tree, as well as an acquired taste. If someone turns up her nose, I change the subject to politics.<br> <br>Academics, of course, don&#x2019;t have a monopoly on passing judgment. During a moment of calm at searches, sometimes a sheriff deputy or police officer will ask about what I do for a living. When I tell them I teach at a university, some wince as well, eyeing me for signs of effeteness&#x2014;and weakness. Then, temporarily at least, we forget about our differences and continue the search, where we are on common ground.<br> <br>Solo has no idea that I have a split life, or that he&#x2019;s partly the cause of it. Why should he? He&#x2019;s a dog. He&#x2019;s unaware that human death and decay cause disgust or ambivalence. For him, death is a tug toy. For me, Solo is the ideal intermediary between me and death. When we search&#x2014;but even when we train&#x2014;he becomes the center of my universe, narrowing my scope to the area we&#x2019;re searching. My job is to guide him when needed but let him do his job independent of me, to make sure he has plenty of water and isn&#x2019;t too close to traffic or a backyard Rottweiler, and to watch him closely the entire time, as he tests the air currents and reacts to them.<br> <br>Looking for a body is an idiosyncratic way of walking in the woods. If I come across a snapping turtle or see an indigo bunting flash in the trees, or if the winter woods open onto an abandoned tobacco barn surrounded with golden beech trees, the pleasure remains, though the reason for being there is a somber one. And it&#x2019;s not all beauty out there: The hidden barbed-wire fences, the catbrier and poison ivy, the deadfall, clear cuts, and garbage dumps that litter the woods all demand my attention, and they get it. Though Solo doesn&#x2019;t love pushing through briar, other than that, even in junkyards or abandoned homesteads, he enjoys sticking his nose into the dark hollows and spaces created by piles of rusted-out heaps and old foundations. I worry more about copperheads, jagged metal, and broken glass than I do about the dangers posed by people, even when a case involves homicide. I do know more about the drug trade in North Carolina than I did before, and I avoid certain truck stops along the I-40 corridor, even if the fuel gauge is near empty.<br> <br>Overall, the world seems less frightening with a large dog at your side&#x2014;and that is perhaps especially true when one faces death. For thousands of years, and in numerous religions, from Hinduism in India to the Mayan religions in Mesoamerica, the dead have depended on the continued assistance of canines to help guide them wherever they are going. The Zoroastrians wanted a dog present at funerals, though not just any dog. Preferably a &#x201c;four-eyed&#x201d; dog, with a spot of darker fur above each eye. I imagine an ancient shepherd version of Solo doing a gleeful slalom through the mourners.<br> <br>Tragedy, occasional incompetence, and inevitable cruelty are part of the work, a given. I don&#x2019;t forget those facets: They are relevant, but they don&#x2019;t shine, and not just because Solo is present. Savvy police and sheriff investigators, experienced search managers, locals who know every dirt road and creek in the county, and families and communities that care&#x2014;because most do&#x2014;end up occupying much of my selective memory space.<br> <br>Working with this one ebullient German shepherd and his good nose was the beginning of an odyssey that has started to merge worlds I&#x2019;ve loved separately for decades: nature, researching and writing about biology and applied science, and working and playing with animals&#x2014;especially dogs. The dog&#x2019;s nose has led me to environmental biologists, forensic anthropologists, cognitive psychologists, medical examiners, and military researchers. I&#x2019;ve been able to interview, meet, and apprentice with talented working-dog trainers and handlers&#x2014;people I&#x2019;ve ended up liking as much as I like dogs. I&#x2019;ve trained alongside canine handlers and trainers who work with drug, bomb, and patrol dogs. In that world of law enforcement, dogs are not just good friends but irreplaceable extensions, lending noses and ears and sometimes bodies and teeth to their human partners, smelling and hearing things their human handlers cannot, going places most people are reluctant to go.<br> <br>My epiphany was not that working dogs are miraculous&#x2014;by themselves, they aren&#x2019;t&#x2014;but instead, how inextricably linked their success is to the quality of their handlers, and the trainers who train the handlers. Working dogs&#x2019; success is far from a given: It takes imagination, deep knowledge, and constant work to train and handle dogs who work with their noses for a living. These are the dog people whose lives and careers are so interwoven with working canines that it can be difficult to see where the person ends and the dog begins; they complete each other. Not because the work they do is smooth or easy. The opposite is true. Often they are working in dangerous environments, or in the midst of devastation&#x2014;whether from crime, war, climate change, earthquakes, or airplane crashes. The rare perfection of that human and canine partnership in our weird, complex, mechanized world is what keeps working dogs from obsolescence. Working dogs are a holdover from simpler times. Sometimes they&#x2019;re seen as a sentimental and unnecessary indulgence. Not all dog-and-handler teams are effective. But when they are good, they are very, very good: They can distinguish scent, cover territory, and accomplish tasks that no machine is capable of. We have new needs for the old work of dogs.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t handle and train dogs full-time. I probably will always be a serious hobbyist. Despite the nightmares I have when I make errors, I still return. I&#x2019;m hooked. As I get better at juggling university demands and training demands, and as I learn to deal with the inevitable sadness, what remains is the intense physical and mental challenge of stripping a search to its essential elements so the dog can do his best work. Walking in the woods with Solo, as scent starts to loft in the morning warmth, I can concentrate so fiercely on our surroundings that time slows and warps. Or I can simply enjoy a night of training as the fireflies come out and Solo waltzes through solving a complex scent problem, a dancing figure in the dark.<br> <br>He is a dog who both lives and narrates as his brown eyes snap with pleasure and impatience and he comes bounding across a cow pasture to lead me back to what he has discovered two hundred feet away.<br> <br>Hey, come here, will you? Quick. The dead stuff is over here. Let me show you.</p><h2>From Fear to Faith: Rejoicing In The Lord In Turbulent Times</h2><p>The country was on the brink of a devastating invasion. Famine threatened. Violence and social injustice filled the land. Habakkuk the Old Testament prophet had every reason to sink into despair. Where was God in these turbulent times? D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones was one of the twentieth century&#39;s foremost preachers and Bible teachers. The parallels he draws between the message of Habakkuk and the crisis-ridden West are still powerfully relevant to our own times. Here is the secret of the problem of history. No event, however catastrophic, fails to find a place in God&#39;s loving purpose for humanity. Habakkuk&#39;s great assertion of faith, in the midst of enormous personal upheaval and emotional strain, can be ours: &#34;Yet I rejoice in the LORD . . . The Sovereign LORD is my strength.&#34;</p><p>D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones (1899-1981), minister of Westminster Chapel in London for thirty years, was one of the foremost preachers of his day. His many books have brought profound spiritual encouragement to millions around the world.</p><h2>The Knight and the Dragon</h2><p>What happens when a sheepish knight and a not-so-fierce dragon fight for the very first time?

Typically, a bean plaki is made with giant white lima beans called gigantes. The beans are first cooked and then stewed in a fresh tomato sauce until the tomato coats the beans like a thick dressing or glaze. In the summer, my husband, farmer Chris Kurth, grows amazing fresh wax beans called dragon&#x2019;s tongue. These are wide, flat, juicy, and speckled with purple spots. They are similar in shape to Romano beans, which are a fine substitute. I like to make plaki with fresh beans and add other vegetables like corn and sweet peppers. Variations of plaki are served warm or cold as a meze on the menus at Sofra, Oleana, and our third restaurant, Sarma. When corn and dragon&#x2019;s tongue beans are not in season, we use cooked gigantes or Peruvian limas and make the traditional version. You&#x2019;ll want to make a big batch of this to have on hand for the week. Simply serve with a chunk of feta and it&#x2019;s a perfect quick meal.&nbsp;<br><br>1&#x2044;4 cup extra-virgin olive oil<br> 1 small summer onion, such as Ailsa Craig or Vidalia, finely chopped&nbsp;<br> 1 carrot, peeled and diced small<br> 1 small (or half of 1 large) green bell pepper, stemmed, seeded, and diced small<br> 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic&nbsp;<br> 3 cups dragon&#x2019;s tongue beans or other wax beans, cut into 1&#x2044;2-inch pieces&nbsp;<br> 3 cups fresh, in-season sweet corn kernels (from about 3 cobs)<br> 6 plum tomatoes, halved&nbsp;<br> 2 teaspoons tomato paste<br> 1 bay leaf<br> 1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill or tarragon leaves<br> 1 teaspoon sherry vinegar<br> 1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice<br> Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper&nbsp;<br><br>Place a large deep-sided saut� pan over medium-low heat and add 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the onion, carrot, and bell pepper and saut� until they begin to soften and the onion is translucent, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic, beans, and corn and continue to cook until they start to soften, about 10 minutes.&nbsp;<br><br>Meanwhile, using your fingers, scrape as many seeds out of the cavities of the tomato as you can without being too fussy. Over a mixing bowl, use the large holes of a box grater to grate the tomatoes (holding the cut side of the tomato to the grater) until you have nothing but skin left in your hand and the flesh of the tomato is in the bowl. Stir the grated tomatoes into the corn mixture and add the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the tomato paste, and the bay leaf.<br><br>Cook until the mixture has thickened and become jamlike, about 20 minutes on low heat. The tomato sauce should coat and cling to the beans and the corn. Pour the plaki into a large mixing bowl and cool to room temperature.<br> Remove the bay leaf and stir in the dill, vinegar, and lemon juice and season with 1 teaspoon of salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Serve at room temperature or cold. This salad can easily be made a day or two before serving; the flavors become better overnight. Store it covered in the refrigerator up to 4 days.</p><h2>The Play&#39;s the Thing: Teachers&#39; Roles in Children&#39;s Play (Early Childhood Education Series)</h2><p><p>Responding to current debates on the place of play in schools, the authors have extensively revised their groundbreaking book.

It proves this early date for Revelation by providing both internal evidence from within Revelation and external evidence from Church history and tradition. It provides much exposition of the text of Revelation.

Born and raised in Spain, Remedios Varo received her earliest training in Madrid before fleeing the Spanish Civil War in 1937 to join Surrealist circles in Paris. The outbreak of World War II forced her to take refuge in Mexico, where she remained until her untimely death in 1963, and where she created her most enduring work. Known as one of the three &#x201c;brujas&#x201d; (witches) active in the Mexico City art milieu, Varo shared an interest in esotericism with fellow painter Leonora Carrington and a range of interests in science, philosophy and the literature of German Romanticism with the photographer Kati Horna. For some ten years, from the mid&#x2013;1950s until her death in 1963, Varo devoted herself to creating an extraordinary dreamlike oeuvre, on the threshold between mysticism and modernity. Her beautifully crafted images of medieval interiors, occult workshops and androgynous figures engaged in alchemical pursuits evoke the eerie allegories of Hieronymus Bosch, esoteric engravings and the charm and lure of fairytales. This catalogue includes a complete illustrated chronology with never before published images and describes Varo&#x2019;s role in the Mexican Surrealist movement and her relations with Luis Bu�uel, Octavio Paz, Benjamin P�ret, Alice Rahon, Wolfgang Paalen and many others.<br><br><b>Remedios Varo</b> (1908&#x2013;1963) fled the Spanish Civil War and then World War II to settle in Mexico where she helped establish a Mexican Surrealist movement and painted visions that combined modernism with mysticism. She was married to the leading French Surrealist Benjamin P�ret.</p><p>Remedios Varo y Uranga (1908-1963) was raised in a traditional middle-class family in Spain and rigorously trained at the prestigious San Fernando Academy in Madrid, Dali&#39;s alma mater. Varo first found her place in the bohemian avant-garde group in Barcelona. After fleeing the Spanish Civil War with surrealist poet Benjamin Peret, she joined the circle of surrealists in Paris in 1937, and her experimental works were included in surrealist publications and exhibitions. The outbreak of World War II forced her to flee Nazi-occupied Paris. She eventually found refuge in Mexico with Peret, who would later become her husband. She remained there until her untimely death in 1963. For some ten years, from the mid 1950s to 1963, Varo devoted herself to producing her intricate fairy tales, rich with subtle wit, humour and fantasy, for which she has been acclaimed as one of the most talented women surrealists in 20th century art.</p><h2>The Return of the Ragpicker</h2><p>In the sequel to The Greatest Miracle in the World, the inspirational self-help author offers a set of principles designed to point readers toward a more promising and prosperous future.</p><p><b>Og Mandino</b>&nbsp;is one of the most widely read inspirational and self-help authors in the world. Former president of <i>Success Unlimited</i> magazine, Mandino was the first recipient of the Napoleon Hill Gold Medal Award for literary achievement. Og Mandino was a member of the Council of Peers Award for Excellence Speaker Hall of Fame and was honored with a Master of Influence Award by the National Speakers Association. Og Mandino died in 1996, but his books continue to inspire countless thousands all over the world.A Special Message from Og Mandino<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> The mysterious old ragpicker, Simon Potter, who disappeared at the end of my book, The Greatest Miracle in the World&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> Did I ever expect to be writing about him again, in some future book?<br> &nbsp;<br> For more than fifteen years, my response to hundreds of interviewers and thousands of letters was always the same&nbsp;...&nbsp;&#x201c;not likely.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> And so, you are now holding a book that I had never planned to write. If life is a series of surprises, as Emerson wrote, then the book you are about to read certainly ranks as a major surprise in a career that has been filled with them.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the past quarter century my life has also been blessed with more good fortune and honors than any human being deserves.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have shared both hunger and wealth, pain and joy with the woman I love by my side, and I have watched proudly as my two sons grew to manhood, married happily, and embarked on promising careers.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have been inducted into the International Speakers Hall of Fame, received the Napoleon Hill Gold Medal for literary excellence, and read my biography, with pride, in Who&#x2019;s Who in the World.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most important was the fulfillment of my childhood dream and that of my late, beloved mother&nbsp;...&nbsp;to become a writer. That I stumbled along life&#x2019;s often-rutted highways, plus a gutter or two, until I had passed the age of forty before reaching our cherished goal, was my fault and mine alone.<br> &nbsp;<br> In retrospect, those early years of failure, despair, and poverty were far more valuable than any college education could have been. Since 1966, the fourteen books I have written, all dealing with the true meaning of success and happiness and how to capture those two elusive songbirds, have managed to sell more than twenty-five million copies in eighteen languages, from Tokyo to Rome, from Johannesburg to Sydney, from Mexico City to Stockholm! And one of them, The Greatest Salesman in the World, has ascended to especially rarified atmosphere by becoming the best-selling book of all time, in the entire world, in the field of sales! Dream fulfilled!<br> &nbsp;<br> And yet, despite all those book sales and all the attention that The Greatest Salesman, both Part I and Part II, has received through the years, another of my books, The Greatest Miracle in the World, has consistently generated far more mail, since its publication in 1975, than all the other works combined!<br> &nbsp;<br> The Greatest Miracle in the World is the story of my special friendship with a long-haired, giant old man, Simon Potter, who called himself a ragpicker because he spent all his time rescuing humans who had ended up on life&#x2019;s refuse pile. Our accidental first meeting was in the dingy parking lot behind my office building, during the years when I headed Success Unlimited magazine in Chicago, and soon I was stopping by his tiny, book-filled apartment across the street almost nightly before driving to my suburban home. Over several memorable months he shared his sherry, his wisdom, and his compassion with me, and his kindly advice and counsel changed my life forever&nbsp;...&nbsp;for the better. Then, one morning, he vanished without a trace. Amazingly, no one living in his apartment building recognized or admitted to knowing the old man from my description, even including the family residing in what had been his apartment, which they insisted they had occupied for four years! It was almost as if Simon had never existed&nbsp;...&nbsp;except to me! His parting gift, discovered later on my desk, was a powerful piece he had written called &#x201c;The God Memorandum,&#x201d; a document containing four principles one must follow in order to enjoy a more fulfilling life. I shared the &#x201c;Memorandum&#x201d; with all my readers in the book&nbsp;...&nbsp;and they responded!<br> &nbsp;<br> The essence of their messages to me in what has continued, through the years, to be a never-ending avalanche of letters about The Greatest Miracle, is best contained in the following few excerpts from actual letters received:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Just one year ago, at this time, I was preparing to commit suicide. Your words, and those of your friend, the ragpicker in Greatest Miracle, saved my life. Today, I can honestly tell anyone that I am a miracle. Not just to be sober, but alive. Today I have serenity and joy in my life and your words helped carry me through all my days of hell....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I owe you so much. In the summer of &#x2019;83, shortly after my divorce, I sat on a California beach reading The Greatest Miracle in the World with tears rolling down my cheeks. You and that wonderful ragpicker, Simon Potter, were my life support....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For the past twelve years I have been working with dependent, neglected, and delinquent boys, ages ten to seventeen, so I have been able to be one of God&#x2019;s ragpickers, like Simon Potter in your precious book....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am writing to express my gratitude to you for the inspiration and love you project in all of your books. I turn to The Greatest Miracle in the World whenever I get down on myself. I need only read those magnificent words to know that I can make it through any crisis and often I will give copies to friends who are burdened with life&#x2019;s problems....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I am only 12 and already my life felt like it was coming apart. Thank you very much for your book about the old rag-humans picker. I think I got my life back together now, with the help of your book, and almost all the people I know like me. This makes me feel really good....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I shall remember the ragpicker forever....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> An old Texas friend, praising my work several years ago over dinner, proudly announced that he had finally discovered the secret to my success. He said I had reinvented the parable&nbsp;...&nbsp;those precious short fictitious stories of old that always illustrated a moral attitude or religious principle. He was probably closer to the truth than all the book reviews.<br> &nbsp;<br> Did the old ragpicker, Simon Potter, ever actually exist, or was that story, too, a modern parable like so many of my other books? To all those who have raised that question, in one form or another, either during radio, television, or newspaper interviews or in letters, my response has always been and always will be the same, &#x201c;Turn to John 4:48.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will not believe.<br> &nbsp;<br> There has never been, nor will there ever be, any follow-up explanation&nbsp;...&nbsp;either for The Greatest Miracle in the World or for this sequel that you are now holding.<br> &nbsp;<br> Whether your first encounter with Simon Potter was in The Greatest Miracle in the World, many years ago, or still lies in the pages ahead, I welcome you with a loving embrace plus a gentle whisper in your ear. Please waste none of your precious time searching any New Hampshire map for the town of Langville, the setting for this book, because you will seek in vain. Out of respect for the proud, stubborn, and hard-working Yankee townspeople who have a tough enough time tolerating &#x201c;summer folks,&#x201d; much less &#x201c;curiosity seekers,&#x201d; I have altered the descriptions of all easily identifiable landmarks as well as changed the name of that lovely green and granite hamlet that is the locale of my story.<br> &nbsp;<br> By the time you have read the final sentence on the last page of this volume, it is my fervent hope that you, too, will sigh a little and say&nbsp;...<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I shall remember the ragpicker forever....&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Who could ask for more?<br> &nbsp;<br> OG MANDINO<br> New Hampshire</p><h2>Pippi&#39;s Extraordinary Ordinary Day</h2><p>Pippi always does things her own way.

He demonstrates that high levels of cooperation are found where people have to band together to fight off a common enemy, and that this kind of cooperation led to the formation of the Roman and Russian empires, and the United States. But as empires grow, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, conflict replaces cooperation, and dissolution inevitably follows.

It was true that I took drugs, but what no one seemed to understand was that my drug use wasn't any different from their having a drink or two on a Friday night after work. They might have a few vodkas and tonic and let off a bit of steam. I had a couple of lines of cocaine and did likewise.

Apart from the track marks on their arms, they had dirty hair, constantly seemed cold, did a lot of shoulder-hunching, wore cheap sneakers that looked like they'd been bought in Woolworth's, and were, as I've already mentioned, thin.</p><p>I wasn't thin.</p><p>Although it wasn't for the want of trying. I spent plenty of timeon the Stairmaster at the gym. But no matter how much I stairmastered, genetics had the final say. If my father had married a dainty little woman, I might have had a very different life. Very different thighs, certainly.</p><p>Instead, like my two older sisters, Claire and Margaret, I was doomed for people always to describe me by saying, "She's a big girl." Then they always added really quickly "Now, I'm not saying she's fat."</p><p>The implication being that if I was fat, I could at least do something about it.</p><p>"No," they would continue, "she's a fine, big, tall girl. You know, strong."</p><p>I was often described as strong.</p><p>It really pissed me off.</p><p>My boyfriend, Luke, sometimes described me as magnificent. (When the light was behind me and he'd had several beers.) At least that was what he said to me. Then he probably went back to his friends and said, "Now, I'm not saying she's fat. . . "</p><p>The whole drug-addict allegation came about one February morning when I was living in New York.</p><p>It wasn't the first time I felt as if I was on Cosmic Candid Camera. My life was prone to veering out of control and I had long stopped believing that the God who had been assigned to me was a benign old guy with long hair and a beard. He was more like a celestial stand-up comic, and my life was the showcase he used to amuse the other Gods.</p><p>"Wa-atch," he laughingly invites, "as Rachel thinks she's got a new job and that it's safe to hand in her notice on the old. Little does she know that her new firm is just about to go bankrupt!"</p><p>Roars of laughter from all the other gods.</p><p>"Now, wa-atch," he chuckles, "as Rachel hurries to meet her new boyfriend. See how she catches the heel of her shoe in a grating? See how it comes clean off? Little did Rachel know that we had tampered with it. See how she limps the rest of the way?" More sniggers from the assembled gods.</p><p>"But the best bit of all," he laughs, "is that the man she was meeting never turns up! He only asked her out for a bet. Watch as Rachel squirms with embarrassment in the stylish bar. See the looks of pity the other women give her? See how the waiter gives her the extortionate bill for a glass of wine, and best of all, see how Rachel discovers she's left her purse at home?"</p><p>Uncontrollable guffaws.</p><p>The events that led to me being called a drug addict had the same element of celestial farce that the rest of my life had. What happened was, one night I'd sort of overdone it on the enlivening drugs and I couldn't get to sleep. (I hadn't meant to overdo it, I had simply underestimated the quality of the cocaine that I had taken.) I knew I had to get up for work the following morning, so I took a couple of sleeping pills. After about ten minutes, they hadn't worked, so I took a couple more. And still my head was buzzing, so in desperation, thinking of how badly I needed my sleep, thinking of how alert I had to be at work, I took a few more.</p><p>I eventually got to sleep. A lovely deep sleep. So lovely and deep that when the morning came, and my alarm clock went off, I neglected to wake up.</p><p>Brigit, my roommate, knocked on my door, then came into my room and shouted at me, then shook me, then, at her wit's end, slapped me. (I didn't really buy the "wit's end" bit. She must have known that slapping wouldn't wake me, but no one is in good form on a Monday morning.)</p><p>But then Brigit stumbled across a piece of paper that I'd been attempting to write on just before I fell asleep. It was just the usual maudlin, mawkish, self-indulgent poetry-type stuff I often wrote when I was under the influence. Stuff that seemed really profound at the time, where I thought I'd discovered the secret of the universe, but that caused me to blush with shame when I read it in the cold light of day -- the parts that I <i>could</i> read, that is.</p><p>The poem went something like "Mumble, mumble, life..." something indecipherable, "bowl of cherries, mumble, all I get is the pits..." Then -- and I vaguely remembered writing this part -- I thought of a really good title for a poem about a shoplifter who had suddenly discovered her conscience. It was called <i>I can't take anymore.</i></p></p><h2>CCCP: Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed</h2><p><p>Photographer Fr�d�ric Chaubin reveals 90 buildings sited in 14 former Soviet Republics which express what he considers to be the fourth age of Soviet architecture. His poetic pictures reveal an unexpected rebirth of imagination, an unknown burgeoning that took place from 1970 until 1990. Contrary to the 1920s and 1950s, no &#x201c;school&#x201d; or main trend emerges here. These buildings represent a chaotic impulse brought about by a decaying system. Their diversity announced the end of the Soviet Union.</p><p>Taking advantage of the collapsing monolithic structure, the holes in the widening net, architects went far beyond modernism, going back to the roots or freely innovating. Some of the daring ones completed projects that the Constructivists would have dreamt of (Druzhba Sanatorium, Yalta), others expressed their imagination in an expressionist way (Palace of Weddings, Tbilisi). A summer camp, inspired by sketches of a prototype lunar base, lays claim to Suprematist influence (Prometheus youth camp, Bogatyr). Then comes the &#x201c;speaking architecture&#x201d; widespread in the last years of the USSR: a crematorium adorned with concrete flames (Crematorium, Kiev), a technological institute with a flying saucer crashed on the roof (Institute of Scientific Research, Kiev), a political center watching you like Big Brother (House of Soviets, Kaliningrad). This puzzle of styles testifies to all the ideological dreams of the period, from the obsession with the cosmos to the rebirth of identity. It also outlines the geography of the USSR, showing how local influences made their exotic twists before the country was brought to its end.Fr�d�ric Chaubin&#x2019;s Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed was elected best book on architecture of the year 2010 by the International Artbook and Film Festival in Perpignan, France (Festival International du Livre d&#x2019;Art &amp; du Film Perpignan).</p></p><p><p>About the photographer: <br>Frederic Chaubin was born in Phnom Penh in 1959. For the last fifteen years, he has been editor-in-chief of the French lifestyle magazine Citizen K. Since 2000 he has regularly featured his photographic works combining architecture and travel. The CCCP collection research was carried out from 2003 to 2010 in an intuitive process.</p>&#x201c;The wonderfully titled CCCP (Cosmic Communist Constructions Photographed) is the perfect coffee table book for unrepentant Marxists.&#x201d;<br><br>"Eastern Bloc buildings that resemble a sci-fi writer&#x2019;s erotic dream..."</p><h2>The Sable Quean: A Tale from Redwall</h2><p><b>Another Redwall adventure you won't forget!</b> <br><br> The devious ruler Vilaya the Sable Quean and her hordes of vermin have a plan to conquer Redwall.

Below on the riverbank, two rats and a burly stoat squatted around the fire, roasting roots and wild turnips on sharpened sticks. Scraping away ashes and burnt soil, the stoat inspected his half-raw turnip. He spat sourly into the fire.</p><p>&#x201c;Wot sorta vittles is this fer a warrior? Stinkin&#x2019; roots an&#x2019; turnips &#x2019;ard as rocks!&#x201d;</p><p>one of the rats remarked hopefully, &#x201c;If&#x2019;n ye don&#x2019;t fancy it, then �I&#x2019;ll eat it for ye.&#x201d;</p><p>Baring his snaggled teeth, the stoat whipped forth a �dagger. &#x201c;Put a paw near my vittles an&#x2019; �I&#x2019;ll gut yer!&#x201d;</p><p>The other rat nibbled at a ramson root, wincing with disgust. He was in agreement with the stoat. &#x201c;Aye mate, meat&#x2019;s wot we need, a brace o&#x2019; plump woodpigeons, or even a fish. I like fishes.&#x201d;</p><p>The stoat flung his turnip into the fire, scowling. &#x201c;We �don&#x2019;t have ter put up wid this muck. I thought we was Ravagers, not scavengers. Any&#x2019;ow, wot are we supposed t&#x2019;be doin&#x2019;, that&#x2019;s wot �I&#x2019;d like t&#x2019;know?&#x201d;</p><p>The first rat retrieved the turnip from the hot ashes, wip�ing it off on his tattered sleeve. &#x201c;Zwilt the Shade sez Sable Quean wants woodlanders, young uns. So we&#x2019;ve got t&#x2019;stay hid in the area an&#x2019; capture any we sees. That&#x2019;s our orders, mate.&#x201d;</p><p>Testing the edge of his blade on a grimy paw, the stoat grinned wickedly. &#x201c;Young uns would make good meat. Just let me git me paws on a fat dormouse or a chubby liddle squirrel. I&#x2019;d let Zwilt &#x2019;ave the bones to give to the Sable Quean!&#x201d;</p><p>The smaller of the two rats looked fearful. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d do that? I �wouldn&#x2019;t like t&#x2019;be you if Zwilt found out.&#x201d;</p><p>The burly stoat tossed his dagger into the air, catching it skilfully. &#x201c;So, wot if&#x2019;n he did, eh? Lissen, I ain&#x2019;t scared of Zwilt, or &#x2019;is Sable Quean. They �don&#x2019;t bother me!&#x201d;</p><p>The larger rat whispered nervously, &#x201c;Be careful wot ye say. They don&#x2019;t call &#x2019;im Zwilt the Shade for nothin&#x2019;&#x2014;some say &#x2019;e&#x2019;s magic!&#x201d;</p><p>The stoat scoffed. &#x201c;Rubbish! Wot sort o&#x2019; magic, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>The rat took swift glances up and down the bank. &#x201c;Nobeast sees Zwilt, unless &#x2019;e wants &#x2019;em to. They say &#x2019;e can come an&#x2019; go secretly, just as &#x2019;e pleases.&#x201d;</p><p>The big stoat shook his head pityingly. &#x201c;Yer a right ole frogwife if&#x2019;n ye believe that. Shade or no Shade, Zwilt&#x2019;s just a beast like any other. Y&#x2019;see this dagger o&#x2019; mine? Well, one good stab of �it&#x2019;d make Zwilt vanish forever!&#x201d;</p><p>The voice came out of nowhere. &#x201c;How can you do that when �you&#x2019;re already dead, fool?&#x201d;</p><p>Brandishing his weapon, the stoat bounded upright. &#x201c;Who said that&#x2014;who&#x2019;s there?&#x201d;</p><p>From behind his back, a cloaked figure emerged through the smoky willow foliage. With lightning speed and savage strength, it wrenched the stoat&#x2019;s paw backward, sending the dagger spinning. Dust rose as the stoat&#x2019;s back slammed against the ground. He lay there, staring up into the face of Zwilt the Shade.</p><p>The sable was a sight to instil fear into most creatures. Behind the natural mask of dark fur, his eyes were totally black, dead and inscrutable. Zwilt was lean, wiry and very tall for one of his species. Beneath a flowing cloak of dull purple, he wore a snakeskin belt with a broadsword thrust through it. His teeth showed small, white and sharply pointed as he hissed at the hapless stoat.</p><p>&#x201c;You should have believed the rats. They spoke truly.&#x201d;</p><p>The burly stoat gulped. &#x201c;Sire, I was only jestin&#x2019; . . .&#x201d;</p><p>Zwilt held a paw to his lips. &#x201c;Silence. You should not be speaking&#x2014; I&#x2019;ve already told you that you&#x2019;re dead.&#x201d;</p><p>In desperation, the stoat tried to rise. &#x201c;No I �ain&#x2019;t&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>The broadsword appeared suddenly in Zwilt&#x2019;s paws; he swung it like lightning. As the severed head rolled into the river, Zwilt addressed it.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, yes you are. Perhaps you&#x2019;ll believe me now?&#x201d; With�out raising his voice, Zwilt the Shade turned his unblink�ing stare on the two rats. &#x201c;You believe me, �don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>They both nodded wordlessly, in stunned silence.</p><p>The tall killer wiped his blade on the headless carcass. &#x201c;Get this thing out of my sight. Throw it in the river.&#x201d;</p><p>The rats scrambled to obey his order. When they turned back again, he had gone. There was only the fire, dying to embers in the bright summer afternoon. The remains of their former comrade drifted slowly away on the current.</p><p>None of the vermin band known as the Ravagers dared to disobey Zwilt the Shade. His orders came directly from Vilaya, the one they called the Sable Quean.</p><p>2</p><p>Waves broke endlessly on the sands of Mossflower&#x2019;s west�ern shore, with the lonely hissing sigh that is the music of the sea. Late noon sun was still warming the beach above the tideline, where the mountain of Salamandastron tow�ered over all. Brang the Badger Lord and his trusty com�panion, General Flackbuth, sat watching a young hare drilling a group of leverets in the use of the sword. Brang nodded in admiration of the Blademaster.</p><p>&#x201c;I tell ye, Flack, that young Buckler kordyne is by far the best we&#x2019;ve seen here since his grandsire, Feryn. What d&#x2019;ye think, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>The old officer brushed a paw over his drooping mili�tary mustachio. &#x201c;Hmmph, I don&#x2019;t doubt y&#x2019;word, sah, not bein&#x2019; old enough to remember Feryn, wot!&#x201d;</p><p>Brang gave a deep rumbling chuckle. &#x201c;no, of course not. I&#x2019;m the only one on this mountain still alive to tell the tale. That&#x2019;s the trouble with living several life spans more than most beasts. Hoho&#x2014;see that, Flack. Well par�ried, young un!&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler had just returned the stroke of another hare&#x2019;s lunge. With an expert flick, he sent his opponent&#x2019;s sabre whirling in the air. The blade flashed in the sunlight, land�ing point first in the damp sand.</p><p>Executing a swift half turn, the Blademaster disarmed an attacker who had been stealing up on him. He shook his head at the culprit.</p><p>&#x201c;Never hesitate when you see an opening, Tormy. I felt you behind me before I saw you. Remember, a slowbeast is a deadbeast. �You&#x2019;ll have to move faster.&#x201d;</p><p>Tormy picked up his blade ruefully. &#x201c;I say, Buck old thing, d&#x2019;ye think �I&#x2019;ll ever be as jolly good as you are, wot?&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler shrugged. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s up to you, mate. keep prac�tising. Also, if I were you, I&#x2019;d choose a lighter blade. You lack the paw power to wield a sabre. Try a long rapier.&#x201d;</p><p>The leveret cast a longing glance at Buckler&#x2019;s blade. &#x201c;Like that blinkin&#x2019; beauty of yours?&#x201d;</p><p>The Blademaster cleaved air with his own special sword. It was a peculiar hybrid, longer than other rapiers, honed razor- sharp on both edges, with a cross- basketed hilt. The blade was thicker than that of a rapier but superbly tem�pered, to give it flexibility. Buckler winked good-naturedly at his pupil.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s not another sword anywhere like this un. I de�signed it myself, but he made it. �Isn&#x2019;t that right, Brang?&#x201d;</p><p>A flicker of annoyance showed in the Badger Lord&#x2019;s dark eyes. He beckoned Buckler to attend him.</p><p>Saluting the leverets with his blade, Buckler dismissed them. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s enough for today, thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>They returned his salute with various weapons. A sabre, a cutlass, a claymore and a broadsword. Sloping his blade over one shoulder, Buckler wandered over to where the huge badger was seated.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the matter? Have I done something wrong?&#x201d;</p><p>Brang took the sword. He held it, feeling the balance. Bending the supple blade in an arc, he let it twang back, straight as a die.</p><p>&#x201c;I had my doubts about forging this, but you were right&#x2014;it&#x2019;s the perfect weapon for you. I&#x2019;ll tell you what you&#x2019;ve done wrong, young un. not showing your superi�ors the proper respect, that&#x2019;s what!&#x201d;</p><p>Returning the sword, Brang turned his back on Buckler, staring fixedly out to sea. The young Blademaster sighed audibly as General Flackbuth continued where the badger had left off.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the custom, laddie buck, to give title to those who&#x2019;ve jolly well earned it, wot! How dare ye refer to the ruler of Salamandastron as Brang. &#x2019;Tis your duty to address him as m&#x2019;Lord, or sah, d&#x2019;ye hear me?&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler stared coolly at the general. &#x201c;Aye, I hear ye.&#x201d;</p><p>Flackbuth bellowed in his face, &#x201c;I hear ye, General!&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler shrugged, repeating slowly, &#x201c;I hear ye . . . �General.&#x201d;</p><p>Lord Brang turned back, his expression softening as he addressed the young hare. &#x201c;Come up to the forge chamber with me, Buck. It&#x2019;s high time you and I had a talk.&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler gathered up his array of training swords. He piled them into the waiting paws of his trusty assistant, Subaltern Meliton Gubthorpe Digglethwaite, or Diggs, as he was more commonly known. He was the same age as Buckler, though marginally smaller and markedly tubby. They were lifelong friends, if poles apart in their views of mountain life and etiquette. Diggs nodded toward the retreating Badger Lord.</p><p>&#x201c;What ho, Buck, are you in the stew again, wot? Has old Flackbuth slapped a blinkin&#x2019; fizzer on you?&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler winked at his friend. &#x201c;no, it&#x2019;s just that the big fellow wants to give me another lecture. Put the blades away, Diggs. I&#x2019;ll catch up with you in the mess at supper.&#x201d;</p><p>The forge chamber was an airy room, carved from the liv�ing rock. It had all the equipment required by a Forge�beast. Weapons in various stages of construction hung everywhere. There was a low, wide window, facing the open sea, with a magnificent view of the western horizon. Lord Brang was proud of his elderflower and comfrey cor�dial. He poured two tankards, passing one to Buckler and indicating a seat on the window ledge.</p><p>Shaking his striped head wearily, the huge badger spoke. &#x201c;Buckler kordyne, what are we going to do with you, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>A smile hovered about the young hare&#x2019;s lips. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know. Tell me, what are you going to do with me?&#x201d;</p><p>Danger flashed in the badger&#x2019;s eyes for one perilous moment. Then he burst out laughing, landing Buckler a hefty pat on the back, which almost sent him flying out of the window. Brang steadied him.</p><p>&#x201c;Just like your grandsire&#x2014;the same rebellious attitude, same carefree manner. every time I look at you, I see him returned from beyond the silent valleys. Aye, you&#x2019;re the very model of Feryn kordyne. You won&#x2019;t wear Long Pa�trol uniform, don&#x2019;t obey orders, always in trouble. You �don&#x2019;t even speak like a Salamandastron hare. Why is that? What&#x2019;s the matter with you, eh?&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler answered the enquiry with a question. &#x201c;I never knew my grandpa, was he as good as me with a blade?&#x201d;</p><p>Brang replied, as if loath to say the words, &#x201c;Feryn was a great Blademaster, the best I ever set eyes upon . . . until you came along.&#x201d;</p><p>Embarrassed by the sudden compliment, Buckler quickly changed the subject. &#x201c;Tell me again, how did he save your life?&#x201d;</p><p>The sun was starting to drop beyond the horizon. Brang stared out at the crimson aisle it laid upon the calm sea. He never tired of relating the story of his escape from death.</p><p>&#x201c;I was young in those seasons&#x2014;your grandsire, too. We were about the same age as you are now. There was a plague of vermin sweeping the land. They were called the Ravagers. Aye, and a motley horde they were, mur�dering, burning, looting and torturing, right across Moss�flower. Their leader was a silver sable, Armuk Rinn the Conqueror. Something had to be done to protect Redwall and all our woodland friends.</p><p>&#x201c;I sent out Long Patrol Scouts to discover where he made his lair. They tracked Rinn and his Ravagers long and hard. They were located in an old quarry northeast of Redwall Abbey.&#x201d;</p><p>Brang stopped to refill their tankards. He tossed Buck�ler a rough- looking chunk of pastry, with nuts baked into it. The young hare felt quite privileged&#x2014;hardly anybeast was allowed to share the Mountain Lord&#x2019;s scones, which he made himself on his forge. Brang watched him eating with pleasure.</p><p>&#x201c;nothing like Salamandastron Forge Scones. They&#x2019;ll put some iron into your muscles, young un. now, let me see, where was I?&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler reminded him. &#x201c;The scouts had found the ver�mins&#x2019; lair, you said.&#x201d;</p><p>Lord Brang took a sip from his tankard. &#x201c;Aye, so they had. I ordered the full Long Patrol into battle order and marched on the villains. I must tell you, though, I was young and reckless then, wilder than you&#x2019;d ever imagine. I take it �you&#x2019;ve heard of the thing they call Bloodwrath?&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler nodded silently, allowing Brang to explain.</p><p>&#x201c; &#x2019;Tis a terrible affliction, a sickness that drives a beast berserk. I had that Bloodwrath, the mad urge to fight, slay and slaughter. nothing could stand in my way, one beast or a score. When my eyes went red with the rush of blood, I became unstoppable. I outpaced my own hares, charging into that quarry, straight into the foebeast. Fool that I was! The Ravagers had scouted our approach. They were wait�ing for us and had us heavily outnumbered. But I was out of control, roaring Eulalias and laying waste to the �vermin.</p><p>&#x201c;By the blade and the hilt, I fought that day. Everything around me was one red mist, but I battled on. Those Rav�agers pressed me hard&#x2014;I still carry the wounds and scars they gave me. I became cut off from my hares, surrounded, so that I could scarcely move to swing my blade. Then I tripped and fell, the sword slipped from my bloodstained paws.</p><p>&#x201c;That was when I saw him&#x2014;Armuk Rinn, the great sable. He was standing over me, swinging a battleaxe. I knew my fate was sealed, I was a deadbeast. But a miracle occurred. Your grandsire Feryn, my trusty right paw, came hurtling through the air, blade flashing, roaring his war cry. He struck like a thunderbolt, cleaving Armuk Rinn, helmet and head, right through his evil brain!&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler&#x2019;s eyes were shining, even though he had heard the tale before. &#x201c;And that&#x2019;s what settled the battle?&#x201d;</p><p>Brang rose. Crossing to his forge, he leaned down heav�ily upon the bellows. A plume of golden flame and scarlet sparks shot up, illuminating the badger&#x2019;s powerful head, glinting in his fierce eyes. &#x201c;Aye, young un, that was a bat�tle to remember. Though it was my friend Feryn&#x2019;s brave act which carried the day. Those Ravagers who were still alive fled when they saw what happened to the mighty Armuk Rinn. Up until then, the vermin didn&#x2019;t believe he could be defeated.&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler laughed. &#x201c;But my grandpa proved different! That&#x2019;s why you gave him the Coin.&#x201d;</p><p>The Badger Lord scowled. &#x201c;Let me tell you about that thing, young un. It actually was a coin, a golden one, from someplace far beyond the sunset, long ago. When I was very young&#x2014;I recall it was wintertide&#x2014;I was walking the shoreline south of this mountain when I came across the wreck of an old vessel. It was buried deep by the seasons. There wasn&#x2019;t much to see, only a bit of old wood sticking out of the sand. Well, I started digging it up and choos�ing pieces, planning on taking them to old Corporal Cook Magirry. He was a real good old sort, often keeping a little plum duff in the oven for me. Actually it was Magirry who taught me to make Forge Scones.&#x201d;</p><p>Buckler sensed that Brang was going off into tales of his early seasons, so he interrupted. &#x201c;But how did you come across the Coin?&#x201d;</p><p>The badger came back to the point. &#x201c;There was a hole in it, and a rusty iron spike fixing it to what looked like part of a mast.&#x201d; He smiled, winking at the young hare. &#x201c;Twas my secret treasure. I kept it, same as any young un would. That night I inspected the coin.

Through his eyes we see the fall of pagan Rome to the Emperor Constantine, the horrific sack of the Eternal City at the hands of the Visigoths, and the vile aftermath of the Black Death. Ultimately restored by the beauty of the Renaissance, Marius becomes a painter, living dangerously yet happily among mortals, and giving his heart to the great master Botticelli, to the bewitching courtesan Bianca, and to the mysterious young apprentice Armand. But it is in the present day, deep in the jungle, when Marius will meet his fate seeking justice from the oldest vampires in the world. . . .</p><p>Time heals all wounds, unless, of course, you're a vampire. Cuts may heal, burns vanish, limbs reattach, but for the "blood god," the wounds of the heart sometimes stay open and raw for centuries. So it is for Marius, Anne Rice's oft-mentioned and beloved scholar. We've heard parts of his tale in past volumes of the Vampire Chronicles, but never so completely and never from his own lips. In <i>Blood and Gold</i>, Rice mostly (but not entirely) avoids the danger of treading worn ground as she fills out the life and character of Marius the Lonely, the Disenchanted, the Heartsick--a 2,000-year-old vampire "with all the conviction of a mortal man." <p> Plucked from his beloved Rome in the prime of his life and forced into solitude as keeper of the vampire queen and king, Marius has never forgiven the injustice of his mortal death. Thousands of years later, he still seethes over his losses. Immortality for Marius is both a blessing and a curse--he bears "witness to all splendid and beautiful things human," yet is unable to engage in relationships for fear of revealing his burden.</p><p> New readers to the Chronicles may wish for a more fleshed-out, less introspective hero, but Rice's legions of devoted fans will recognize <i>Blood and Gold</i> for what it is: a love song to Marius the Wanderer, whose story reveals the complexities and limitations of eternal existence. <i>--Daphne Durham</i></p><b>&#x201c;Tantalizing . . .

Completely resigned to their fate. A fly landed on the forehead of the nearest one&#x2014;the one he was to kill&#x2014;and the captive let it crawl about, tasting his sweat.</p><p>Jacob listened to the spokesman continue to rail in Arabic, a small crowd gathered in the square, outnumbered two to one by the gunmen. He didn&#x2019;t understand the language but could guess at what was being said.</p><p><i>These men are traitors. This is the fate that befalls all who oppose the </i>Kalipha<i>. Stand with us, or suffer the same.</i></p><p>Far from cheering, the small grouping of people looked cowed, as if they wanted to be anywhere but there. Well, that wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. They&#x2019;d rather be on the outside watching than on their bellies with their necks stretched out.</p><p>The spokesman droned on, building toward a grand spectacle, his black tunic covered in dust, the AK-47 swinging about with his body language, and Jacob knew it was coming close. Execution time. His first.</p><p>In the seven months he&#x2019;d been inside the cult of death known as the Islamic State, he&#x2019;d witnessed many, many executions, acting as a gunman on the periphery, but he&#x2019;d never done one on his own.</p><p>Not that he minded killing. It hadn&#x2019;t bothered him in the past, but the action had always been at the barrel of a gun, and he wondered how this would feel. In a detached, almost scientific way, he wondered if it would be different from carving the carcasses of the rabbits he&#x2019;d killed in his youth. When he&#x2019;d literally had to hunt for survival.</p><p>He looked at his partners, seeing Hussein fidgeting, the nervous tics growing more pronounced. He wasn&#x2019;t built for this cauldron, and Jacob thought it ironic that Hussein was the one who had recruited them. Convinced them to come to this faraway land.</p><p>Not that they had many alternatives after fleeing the cesspool of &#x201c;rehabilitation&#x201d; they&#x2019;d been placed within. Killing the guard had ensured that.</p><p>Carlos and Devon, now known as Yousef and Talib, showed no such hesitation. They had embraced the cult of death completely, changing their names and fervently soaking up the Salafist ideology like a cactus in the rain. They were on board one hundred and ten percent, considering this day a sacred one.</p><p>Jacob played the role, but he&#x2019;d long since lost belief in religion. Any religion. He&#x2019;d had that whipped out of him by the pious Christian guards in the white house.</p><p>No, it wasn&#x2019;t the religion. It was the power. In this land, from Mosul to Raqqa, all that mattered was the courage of the battle-axe, and he&#x2019;d found a skill that he didn&#x2019;t realize he possessed. He knew he would die here, but it caused no angst. In truth, he had died long ago. All that remained was for him to slip the coils of his mortal frame. The difference was a cause. He wouldn&#x2019;t end up as a page-two news story, caught stealing hubcaps and gunned down in the street. And neither would the men he had brought.</p><p>Hussein may have recruited him, and the other two may have changed their names, diving headlong into the myth of the Islamic State, but he was the leader of their small group. Just as he had been inside.</p><p>With that mantle came a responsibility.</p><p>A man in black, completely covered from head to toe, like something out of a <i>Star Wars</i> movie, began walking his way. Jacob inwardly grimaced.</p><p>His name was Abu Yabba Dabba Do, or some other unpronounceable Arabic crap, but Jacob called him Ringo. As in the Beatles. An Islamic fighter from England, he and others like him considered themselves above Jacob and his band because they were of Arabic descent. Ringo was Yemeni. Jacob was a mutt.</p><p>&#x201c;So, Jacob, are you ready for your first kill?&#x201d;</p><p>He drew out the name <i>Jacob</i>, showing his disdain for the Biblical reference and the fact that Jacob refused to take an Arabic one.</p><p>Jacob said, &#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t my first, you shit.&#x201d;</p><p>Ringo smirked and said, &#x201c;Death with a gun is not killing. You&#x2019;ll see. This is absolute control. Absolute. As Mohammad dictated. But your little band of Lost Boys wouldn&#x2019;t know about that.&#x201d;</p><p>He was being tested, which was what he expected. Ringo had beheaded many men, and had developed a cult following on Twitter and other social media, but he was an ass. A small man who gained importance after the fact. After the fighting was done, using his knife and a camera to become famous. At his core, Jacob knew Ringo felt a challenge from him and his friends.</p><p>Four tightly knit brothers, forged by a fire outside the Islamic State, with&#x2014;except for Hussein&#x2014;no attachment to any Arabic or Islamic heritage, they were an anomaly. True foreign fighters in a foreign land. They called themselves the Lost Boys because of the iconic &#x2019;80s movie, but the analogy was apt. They lived in a world of the shadows.</p><p>And they killed better than most.</p><p>Jacob said, &#x201c;Ringo, step away.&#x201d;</p><p>That was all.</p><p>And Ringo did.</p><p>Ringo had seen the punishment the Lost Boys had endured. With two blond Caucasians, one African American, and Hussein, the one who had recruited them, their arrival had been anything but welcoming. Convinced they were spies or, at best, journalists, the emir had subjected them to inhuman conditions and cruelty. And they had thrived.</p><p>Because of the white house.</p><p>Ringo said, &#x201c;You are not the future. <i>We</i> are the future. <i>Kafir</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Jacob looked up, catching Ringo&#x2019;s pompous eyes with the dead ones he possessed, and said, &#x201c;The future is dictated by the man who isn&#x2019;t afraid to die. Is that you?&#x201d;</p><p>Ringo said, &#x201c;I am not afraid. I have proved that multiple times.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you wish to die today? Without fear?&#x201d;</p><p>Jacob knew his reputation from Mosul preceded him. Knew that Ringo hated the fact that he was a blond-headed, blue-eyed American, with no ancestral ties to the coming caliphate, but he also knew that Ringo couldn&#x2019;t get past the stories that had grown into legends.</p><p>Ringo snarled and said, &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see, Lost Boy. We&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;</p><p>And walked away.</p><p>The man on the square finished his speech, which was like every other one, and not unlike speeches given by the blowhard preachers Jacob had heard every night in the reform school. There was a flourish at the end, then a knife placed in his hand.</p><p>He looked at the four men prostrate in front of him, and felt the hatred.</p><p>They were snitches. People who&#x2019;d sold out the clan for money, giving information to the enemy for targeted air strikes and intelligence on how the Islamic State functioned. Jacob would have had qualms about killing someone for eating pork or not wearing a head wrap, but he had none for traitors.</p><p>They were the ones who had caused the pain in his past. Had caused the trips to the white house.</p><p>He looked at his man, a Kurd. Strange that such a person had been able to penetrate so deeply, given the fight against the Peshmerga, but he had. And he&#x2019;d given massive information about the Islamic State to the Americans. Now he would die.</p><p>But the fly on his forehead would live.</p><p>He swished the man&#x2019;s face and saw it buzz away. Then leaned down, wrapping his hand into the hair, pulling it up.</p><p>As he had as a child, when the next &#x201c;new&#x201d; father had come into the room, stinking of whiskey and taking off his belt, he let his humanity float away, flying on a cloud. Gone.</p><p>He became a man of stone.</p><p>He looked down the line, seeing the ubiquitous cameraman recording the killing, then Carlos and Devon eagerly snatching up their own heads and looking to him for guidance. He waited on Hussein.</p><p>He caught the tears on Hussein&#x2019;s cheeks and wondered if the man would go through with it. He saw Ringo advancing and shouted, &#x201c;Hussein!&#x201d;</p><p>His friend looked at him and Jacob said, &#x201c;For the white house. Do it for the white house.&#x201d;</p><p>Hussein rapidly nodded, then pulled up the head.</p><p>Jacob turned to his own man, seeing his eyes rolling back, feeling the shaking in his body, the bright orange smock soaked in sweat.</p><p>The first swipe brought a gout of blood. He reached bone, and began sawing.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Omar al-Khatami watched the tape without a shred of revulsion, technically looking for the propaganda value. His media specialist described how he had enhanced the image, optimizing it for YouTube, and said, &#x201c;This will show the Americans what happens to their spies, and prevent others from following in their steps.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;Yes. Post it tonight. End with the heads on the bodies.&#x201d;</p><p>The door opened and the emir of northern Syria entered.</p><p>Mildly surprised, Omar exchanged greetings and said, &#x201c;Adnan, I thought you weren&#x2019;t returning for two days. What is happening with the oil?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan smiled and said, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s coming along. We only have the wells pumping at a quarter of capacity because of a lack of technical skill, but we have found men to change that. Soon, we will double our output and our revenues. As long as you don&#x2019;t lose the fields.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;No chance of that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good, because I have some news. The caliph has bestowed a great honor on you. He has promoted you to the emir of external operations.&#x201d;</p><p>The mention of the leader of the Islamic State brought a pause. Confused, Omar said, &#x201c;External operations? I am the military commander here. I still have work to do. Aleppo to take. Damascus to burn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The caliph has heard of your Lost Boys, and he thinks it is time to use them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then do so, but don&#x2019;t pull me from my men. They fight because of me. The time is growing short for victory. This will be a setback we can&#x2019;t afford, given the American attacks.&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan scowled and said, &#x201c;The caliph believes in you. And your American cell. He chose you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why? We have many men who could do this. You, for instance.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Because of your skill, for one. And because you are Chechen. You have traveled in Europe. You know the contacts. You can build the attack he desires.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;These Lost Boys are untested. I&#x2019;m unsure of their commitment.&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan looked at the computer screen, the video paused with four men slicing and cutting. &#x201c;Is this not them?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They show commitment here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It could be simple fear. Hussein, the Jordanian, cried throughout.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And the others?&#x201d;</p><p>Omar grudgingly admitted they showed no qualms, but said, &#x201c;The leader of these so-called Lost Boys hasn&#x2019;t even taken a proper name. He still goes by Jacob.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But you tested him, yes?&#x201d;</p><p>Omar nodded. Adnan said, &#x201c;The name is why we want them. They will all revert back to their true names. They are gems buried in the sand. Four Americans with no ties to America. No families, no Facebook, no Twitter. They are unknown. Unlike the others who brag to their friends back home, nobody knows they exist. No authorities are fervently tracking their moves. True?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes. We instructed them on methods of recruitment, but they have shown no interest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. Keep it that way. Their mission will be the greatest recruitment drive we have ever seen.&#x201d;</p><p>The media specialist fidgeted, getting Adnan&#x2019;s attention. He said, &#x201c;Emir, they are on this video. The one we&#x2019;re going to post for the world to see.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t. Broadcast the stills of the verdict, but keep the executioners out.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar said, &#x201c;We lose the impact with our own people. They need to see. They need to fear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then let our men see it, but obscure the faces, and do not put it on social media. The Americans must be protected, and those <i>kafirs</i> in the United States have ways of determining the tiniest things.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar nodded. &#x201c;It will be done. What about me?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan looked at him with a question, and he said, &#x201c;When do you wish me to start, and what will the target be?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Targets. Plural. Every attack attempted by that windbag Zawahiri and his diseased al Qaida has resulted in failure because the <i>kafirs</i> managed to hear about it before execution. We have to assume the same will happen here, so we will plan two attacks. One for them to chase, and one for you to execute.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar went through the ramifications in his mind. Having fought in Grozny against a barbaric Russian army, he recognized the wisdom. He said, &#x201c;Just preparation for the false flag attack?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, no. A real attack. One that you will plan from start to finish. You pick the target and the method. The only parameter is that it must be outside of the caliphate. Outside the borders here. If it succeeds, so much the better, but its primary mission is to protect your American cell. Obviously, don&#x2019;t tell the other team about that. Let them think they are the chosen ones.&#x201d;</p><p>Omar absorbed the words, glancing away and nodding, thinking through the possibilities. He said, &#x201c;And the real target?&#x201d;</p><p>Adnan smiled and said, &#x201c;The real one will destroy the heart of the <i>kafirs</i>.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>3</p><p>Waiting on the president to finish, eyes glued to a television, Colonel Hale sat with the rest of the Oversight Council, watching him getting raked over the coals in the White House James S. Brady Press Briefing Room. Kurt heard a little exasperation escape President Warren, a sign of the pressure he was under. Kurt felt for the president, but was glad it wasn&#x2019;t him on the stage. The conversation would have been much less civil.</p><p>&#x201c;Kathy, I don&#x2019;t know how to make it any more plain. None of the men in the picture are either American or working for United States intelligence. They are not in any capacity agents of the United States. Clearly, those barbarians will kill anyone just to prove a point. And that point is fear.&#x201d;</p><p>The hands in the pressroom rose again and President Warren said, &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; then walked off, hearing a chorus of shouted questions. Sitting in the Old Executive Office Building next door to the White House, Kurt knew it would be a good ten minutes before he arrived for their meeting.</p><p>He looked around the room. Only half of the thirteen members of the Council were present, the other half most likely getting castigated right now in the Oval Office over the scourge of the Islamic State.</p><p>Kurt knew how President Warren felt: impotent.</p><p>For nearly a decade he&#x2019;d been hunting terrorists with a unique counterterrorist organization that had unparalleled success; yet despite its efforts, a greater threat had appeared. Not only appeared but had thrived like the spread of Ebola in a ward of children. And his unit could do nothing about it.</p><p>The thought made him sick, driving home the fact that the application of military force would never be decisive in this fight. The roots were too deep, and the siren call too sweet. No matter how many terrorists he prevented from individually killing, there was a pervading ability for ideology to transcend logical thought, spreading like a cancer through whole societies he would have otherwise thought normal, civilized humans.</p><p>Because of it, the Islamic State had become the most powerful terrorist organization on the face of the earth.</p><p>Encompassing broad swaths of terrain across Syria and Iraq, the group possessed a brutality unheard-of in the modern world. But it was not unlike the history of the past. The Islamic State cowed its opponents with an unparalleled ability to instill fear, using new social media grafted on twelfth-centu...</p></p><h2>Essential Oils And Cancer: How To Effectively Use The Right Essential Oils To Confuse And Kill Cancer Cells</h2><p>Essential oils have been used for centuries to help support the immune system and bring the body back to health.

But in this world, there are two moons in the sky. In this world, the fates of two people, Tengo and Aomame, are closely intertwined. They are each, in their own way, doing something very dangerous. And in this world, there seems no way to save them both. Something extraordinary is starting.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, October 2011:</strong> The year is 1984, but not for long. Aomame, on her way to meet a client--the gravid implications of which only come clear later--sits in a taxi, stuck in traffic. On a lark, she takes the driver's advice, bolts from the cab, walks onto the elevated Tokyo expressway, descends an emergency ladder to the street below, and enters a strange new world. <br><br>In parallel, a math teacher and aspiring novelist named Tengo gets an interesting offer. His editor has come upon an entry for a young writer's literary prize, a story that, despite its obvious stylistic drawbacks, strikes a deeply moving chord with those who've read it. Its author is a mysterious 17-year-old, and the editor proposes that Tengo quietly rewrite the story for the final round of the competition. <br><br>So begins Haruki Murakami's <em>magnus opus</em>, an epic of staggering proportions. As the tale progresses, it folds in a deliciously intriguing cast of characters: a physically repulsive private investigator, a wealthy dowager with a morally ambiguous mission, her impeccably resourceful bodyguard, the leader of a somewhat obscure and possibly violent religious organization, a band of otherworldly "Little People," a door-to-door fee collector seemingly immune to the limits of space and time, and the beautiful Fuka-Eri: dyslexic, unfathomable, and scarred. <br><br>Aomame names her new world "1Q84" in honor of its mystery: "Q is for 'question mark.' A world that bears a question.'" Weaving through it, central motifs--the moon, Jan�&#x10d;ek's Sinfonietta, George Orwell's 1984--acquire powerful resonance, and Aomame and Tengo's paths take on a conjoined life of their own, dancing with a protracted elegance that requires nearly 1,000 pages to reach its crowning denouement. <br><br><em>1Q84</em> was a runaway best seller in its native Japan, but it's more instructive to frame the book's importance in other ways. For one, it's hard not to compare it to James Joyce's <em>Ulysses</em>. Both enormous novels mark their respective author's most ambitious undertaking by far, occupy an artificially discrete unit of time (<em>Ulysses</em>, one day; <em>1Q84</em>, one year), and can be read as having a narrative structure that evinces an almost quantum-mechanical relationship to reality, which is not to say that either author intended this. <br><br>More to the point, the English translation of <em>1Q84</em>--easily the grandest work of world literature since Roberto Bola�o's <em>2666</em>--represents a monstrous literary event. Now would somebody please award Murakami his Nobel Prize? --<em>Jason Kirk</em>Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949 and now lives near Tokyo.

Then she said, "How hard can that be?" &nbsp;I woke up the next morning and started writing--and also had an epiphany that novels were what I should have been doing all along. The story took over and absolutely consumed my thinking from the moment I started until I finished the first draft--only about six weeks later. &nbsp;And it was so, so fun. &nbsp;I'd fallen in love with writing and words and syllables and letters and stories and poems long before, as a kid.

He soon finds himself aboard a ship, on its way to Northern Canada.

An inquest was called for and four recommendations were made to ensure the safety of indigenous students. None of those recommendations were applied.</p><p>More than a quarter of a century later, from 2000 to 2011, seven indigenous high school students died in Thunder Bay, Ontario. The seven were hundreds of miles away from their families, forced to leave home because there was no high school on their reserves. Five were found dead in the rivers surrounding Lake Superior, below a sacred indigenous site. Jordan Wabasse, a gentle boy and star hockey player, disappeared into the -20� Celsius night. The body of celebrated artist Norval Morrisseau&#x2019;s grandson, Kyle, was pulled from a river, as was Curran Strang&#x2019;s. Robyn Harper died in her boarding-house hallway and Paul Panacheese inexplicably collapsed on his kitchen floor. Reggie Bushie&#x2019;s death finally prompted an inquest, seven years after the discovery of Jethro Anderson, the first boy whose body was found in the water. But it was the death of twelve-year-old Chanie Wenjack that foreshadowed the loss of the seven.</p><p>Using a sweeping narrative focusing on the lives of the students, award-winning investigative journalist Tanya Talaga delves into the history of this small northern city that has come to manifest Canada&#x2019;s long struggle with human rights violations against indigenous communities.</p></p><p><p>TANYA TALAGA is the acclaimed author of <em>Seven Fallen Feathers</em>, which was the winner of the RBC Taylor Prize, the Shaughnessy Cohen Prize for Political Writing, and the First Nation Communities READ: Young Adult/Adult Award; a finalist for the Hilary Weston Writers&#x2019; Trust Nonfiction Prize and the BC National Award for Nonfiction; CBC&#x2019;s Nonfiction Book of the Year, a <em>Globe and Mail</em> Top 100 Book, and a national bestseller. Talaga was the 2017&#x2013;2018 Atkinson Fellow in Public Policy, the 2018 CBC Massey Lecturer, and author of the national bestseller <em>All Our Relations: Finding The Path Forward</em>. For more than twenty years she has been a journalist at the Toronto Star and is now a columnist at the newspaper. She has been nominated five times for the Michener Award in public service journalism. Talaga is of Polish and Indigenous descent. Her great-grandmother, Liz Gauthier, was a residential school survivor. Her great-grandfather, Russell Bowen, was an Ojibwe trapper and labourer. Her grandmother is a member of Fort William First Nation. Her mother was raised in Raith and Graham, Ontario. She lives in Toronto with her two teenage children.</p><p>It&#x2019;s early April and the 2011 federal election is in full swing. All over Canada, Stephen Harper&#x2019;s Conservatives are duking it out with Jack Layton&#x2019;s New Democrats and the struggling Liberals in a bid to win a majority government.</p><p>I&#x2019;m in Thunder Bay, Ontario, to see Stan Beardy, the Nishawbe-Aski Nation&#x2019;s grand chief, to interview him for a story on why it is indigenous people never seem to vote.</p><p>The receptionist at the NAN&#x2019;s office greets me and ushers me into a large, common meeting room to wait for Stan. Everything in the room is grey &#x2015; the walls, the tubular plastic tables, the carpets. The only splash of colour is a large white flag with a bear on it that has been tacked to the wall.</p><p>The Great White Bear stands in the centre of a red circle, in the middle of the flag. The white bear is the traditional symbol of the life of the North American Indian. The red circle background is symbolic of the Red Man. His feet are standing, planted firmly on the bottom line, representing the Earth while his head touches the top line, symbolic to his relationship to the Great Spirit in the sky. The bear is stretched out, arms and feet open wide, to show he has nothing to hide.</p><p>There are circles joining the bear&#x2019;s rib cage. They are the souls of the people, indigenous songs, and legends. The circles are the ties that bind all the clans together.</p><p>These circles also offer protection. Without them, the ribcage would expose the great bear&#x2019;s beating heart and leave it open to harm.</p><p>Stan walks in and greets me warmly, his brown eyes twinkling as he takes a seat.</p><p>Stan is pensive, quiet, and patient. He says nothing as he wearily leans back in his chair and waits for me to explain why exactly I flew 2,400 km north from Toronto to see him and talk about the federal election.</p><p>I launch into my spiel, trying not to sound like a salesperson or an interloper into his world, someone who kind of belongs here and kind of does not. This is the curse of my mixed blood. I am the daughter of a half-Anish mom and a Polish father.</p> <p>I ramble off abysmal voting pattern statistics across Canada, while pointing out that in many ridings indigenous people could act as a swing vote, influencing that riding and hence the trajectory of the election.</p><p>Stan stares at me impassively. Non-plussed.</p><p>So I start firing off some questions.</p><p>It doesn&#x2019;t go well. Every time I try to engage him, asking him about why indigenous people won&#x2019;t get in the game and vote, he begins talking about the disappearance of fifteen-year-old Jordan Wabasse.</p><p>It was a frustrating exchange, like we were speaking two different languages.</p><p>&#x201c;Indigenous voters could influence fifty seats across the country if they got out and voted but they don&#x2019;t. Why?&#x201d; I ask.</p><p>&#x201c;Why aren&#x2019;t you writing a story on Jordan Wabasse? He has been gone seventy-one days now,&#x201d; replies Stan.</p><p>&#x201c;Stephen Harper has been no friend to indigenous people yet if everyone voted, they could swing the course of this election,&#x201d; I continue, hoping he&#x2019;ll bite at the sound of Harper&#x2019;s name. The man is no friend of the Indians.</p><p>&#x201c;They found a shoe down by the water. Police think it might have been his,&#x201d; replies Stan.</p><p>This went on for a good fifteen minutes. I was annoyed. I knew a missing Grade 9 indigenous student in Thunder Bay would not make news in urban Toronto at Canada&#x2019;s largest daily newspaper. I could practically see that election bus rolling away without me.</p><p>Then I remembered my manners and where I was.</p><p>I was sitting with the elected grand chief of 23,000 people and he was clearly trying to tell me something.</p><p>I tried a new tactic. I&#x2019;d ask about Jordan and then I&#x2019;d swing around and get him to talk about elections.</p><p>Then Stan said: &#x201c;Jordan is the seventh student to go missing or die while at school.&#x201d;</p><p>Seven.</p><p>Stan says their names: &#x201c;Reggie Bushie. Jethro Anderson. Paul Panacheese. Curran Strang. Robyn Harper. Kyle Morrisseau. And now, Jordan Wabasse.&#x201d;</p><p>He then tells me the seven were hundreds of miles away from their home communities and families.</p><p>Each was forced to leave their reserve simply because there was no high school for them to attend.</p><p>&#x201c;Going to high school is the right of every Canadian child,&#x201d; says Stan, adding that these children are no different.</p></p><h2>Lumberjanes Vol. 7: A Bird&#39;s-Eye View (7)</h2><p>All Lumberjanes are on deck when the High Council comes to camp for inspection!<br><br>The High Council is coming to camp and counselor Jen is determined to make everything perfect, even though a storm is brewing and kittens from the boys&#x2019; camp are manifesting magical powers.

His epic, character-driven narrative not only restores to our collective memory the indelible story of American labor, it also demonstrates the importance of the fight for fairness and economic democracy, and why that effort remains so urgent today.</p></p><p><p><b>Philip Dray </b>is the author of <i>At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America</i>, which won the Robert F.

He lives in Brooklyn, New York.</p>CHAPTER ONE: THE OPPRESSING HAND OF AVARICE<br><br>It seems fitting that one of the first renowned activistsin the titanic struggle between labor and capital on this continent, Sarah G.Bagley, was an unassuming young woman off the farm, initially no different fromany of the thousands who emerged from rural New England in the 1820s and 1830s to become "operatives" in the textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts, the nation's earliest industrial city. This original population of American factory workers was, for a generation, the pride of the youthful United States, and Lowell a model of enlightened industrialism that visitors were drawn fromacross the country and around the world to behold with their own eyes.<br><br>Bagley, like most of her peers, shared in the public's fascination; only after many years did she grow concerned about the system'sinjustices. In an era when few if any women spoke publicly she found her voice, first as a writer, then as a labor organizer, eventually leading the LowellFemale Labor Reform Association, which she helped create, in its historic fight for decent work conditions and a ten-hour day. At turns eloquent and caustic,her challenge to the status quo brought her into open conflict with Lowell'spowerful mill and banking interests, the legislature of the state ofMassachusetts, and even many of her cohorts and friends.<br><br>Born in Candia, New Hampshire, in 1806, where her parents, two brothers, and a sister farmed and operated a sawmill, Bagley worked as a schoolteacher before moving to Lowell in 1837. Beyond those fewfacts not much is known of her early life, although there are what may be intriguing glimpses into her background in two stories she wrote for the <i>Lowell Offering</i>, the independent literary journal published by women mill workers and celebrated here and in Europe as evidence of the superiority of America's factory culture. In one tale Bagley describes a young farm girl unhappy withher fate as a household domestic, who, smitten by "Lowell fever,"dreams of being a worker in the booming mill city thirty miles distant. So poor she doesn't own a pair of shoes in which to travel, the little heroine nonetheless defies her cruel mistress and runs away. A kindly stage coach driver takes pity on the barefoot child he encounters walking along the road, her few possessions in a knotted bundle, and, asking no fare, delivers her to Lowell.There, within days, she is reborn, with new acquaintances, a job in a mill, and even the beginnings of a modest bank account. In the second story, a Lowell mill hand named Catherine B., suffering from dire homesickness, receives the terrible news that her mother and father have both died. Stricken by grief but determined to save her younger brother and sister from poverty, she rededicatesherself to the steady job she is fortunate to hold in a Lowell factory. For her brave display of "practical benevolence," Catherine is wooed formarriage by a desirable man.<br><br>"Lowell fever" the lure of the textile mills, of factory work at good wages, was remarked upon by many who flocked to the teeming little city. Not only did mill work pay better than the other jobs opento Yankee farm girls, chiefly those of teacher, nanny, or domestic, it offered escape from the other common alternative-grueling, unpaid labor on the family farm. The role of independent worker better suited the freeborn American women of Bagley's time. The first young people to come of age in the postrevolutionary era, they "expected to make something of themselves andof life," Lucy Larcom, a Lowell operative who entered the mills at age eleven, later remembered. Young women like Larcom and Bagley, no less than John Greenleaf Whittier, a Lowell resident, Henry W. Longfellow, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Ralph Waldo Emerson-who would write that "the children ofNew England between 1820 and 1840 were born with knives in their brains" were swept up in the intellectual ferment, heightened spirituality, and openness to new ideas that characterized the nation in the age of Jackson. These expectations led increasingly from the countryside to the civilization of theindustrialized town.<br><br>For young women the initial benefits of the transition were abundant. The Lowell factory/boardinghouse system offered a safe living environment (a reassurance to their parents), a peek at the wider world, the chance to meet like-minded young people, as well as a sort of undergraduateeducation in its after-work classes, reading rooms, and occasional lyceumlectures. A girl from Maine reported that she was drawn to Lowell chiefly for access to the town's lending library, from which she was observed to withdrawas many as four novels per week. Some arrivals hailed from illustrious New England families. Harriet Curtis, editor of the Lowell Offering, traced herlineage to Miles Standish; Harriet Robinson's great-grandfather had sold Thomas Brattle the land on which much of Harvard College stood; Harriet Farley wasdescended from a long line of famous New England clerics, including the eccentric Joseph "Handkerchief" Moody, whose practice of hiding hisface behind a black veil inspired a Nathaniel Hawthorne short story. Curtis,even before arriving at Lowell, had made her reputation as the author of apopular novel, Kate in Search of a Husband, although, as an historian notes,"the earnings of a mill operative...were larger and more dependable thanany she could expect from the writing of fiction."<br><br>Bagley mentions these advantages and more in "The Pleasures of Factory Life," published in the Offering in 1840. She writesof the mill girls' wages assisting distant relatives, the broadening experienceof meeting women from other states and towns, and exposure through the lyceumlectures to the likes of Emerson and John Quincy Adams. But it was the busyfactories, the enormous workrooms of looms and spindles synchronized as onegiant, interlocking mechanism, that most impressed her. "In the mill we see displays of the wonderful power of the mind," she wrote. "Who canclosely examine all the movements of the complicated, curious machinery, andnot be led to the reflection, that the mind is boundless, and is destined torise higher and still higher; and that it can accomplish almost anything on which it fixes its attention!"<br><br>Thomas Jefferson would have liked Lowell. The hummingmill town that grew up at the confluence of the Concord and Merrimack rivers,with its systematized production methods and lending libraries, might havestruck the Sage of Monticello as an acceptable solution to his concerns about the development of manufacturing in America. He had prized the ideal of the United States as a pastoral world, its citizens enriched by their closeness tothe soil, free of the drudgery and regimentation of industry. "Those who labor in the earth are the chosen people of God if ever he had a chosen people,whose breasts he has made his peculiar deposit for substantial and genuine virtue," he had written in Notes on the State of Virginia, published in1787. "While we have land to labor...let us never wish to see our citizensoccupied at a workbench, or twirling a distaff."<br><br>His vision of America as a perpetual garden was not far-fetchedin the 1780s, for nine of ten Americans still lived on farms, land was available and affordable, and to the west of the Colonies lay vast unsettled territory. Large-scale manufacturing, he believed, might best remain in Europe, as the cost of importing factory goods would be worth the benefit of preservingthe American landscape, its people and government, from the baleful influences of industrial development already seen in British manufacturing cities. An immigrant who crossed the ocean hoping to make his mark in industry would quickly transfer his ambition to farming once he saw firsthand the benefits of such an independent calling.<br><br>Jefferson, however, was also known for his interest inanthropology, science, and mechanical innovation. To love America as he did wasto love its clockmakers, gunsmiths, shed-bound dreamers of a thousand tinkered mechanical schemes, as well as its "natural philosophers," men likeJohn and William Bartram of Philadelphia, who traipsed the Appalachians for plant specimens and Indian relics. As president, Jefferson filled the East Roomof the Executive Mansion with mastodon bones collected at Big Salt Lick on theOhio River. He appreciated, too, the ingenious homespun textile crafts ofdiligent American women.<br><br>&nbsp;These fabrics were also favored by George Washington, who spun cotton himself at his home at Mount Vernon and who disparaged the wearingof imported fabrics by Americans as a symbol of continuing reliance on GreatBritain. "I hope it will not be a great while before it will be unfashionable for a gentleman to appear in any other dress (excepthomespun)," remarked the first president. "Indeed, we have alreadybeen too long subject to British prejudices. I use no porter or cheese in my family, but such as is made in America."<br><br>Gradually Jefferson accepted that his belief in a"permanently undeveloped, rural America" was more a cherished idealthan an actual program for the country's future; by 1789 he was, in a letter toa friend, describing Virginia as a likely site for the development of textile mills. Manufacturing in the Colonies had been suppressed during the decades ofBritish authority, including such edicts of Parliament as the Hat Act of 1732,intended to keep Americans from exploiting the New World's ample supply of beaver pelts, and the Iron Act of 1750, meant to keep the Colonies reliant onimports. Reaction to such arbitrary laws and to British rule in general hadinspired self-recognition on the part of American workers as well as the first organized efforts to use consumer habits to thwart English profits. It was inthe period of resentment over the Stamp Act in the 1760s that artisans andcraftsmen began calling themselves "Mechanicks," coinciding with their growing presence as a political force. In the 1770s appeared the first "Buy American" campaign, as from Boston to Charleston the cry arose to eschew the purchase of British-made objects and sell and buy only indigenous manufactures.<br><br>The Revolution and then the War of 1812 revealed starkly America's lack of industrial self-reliance. "To be independent for thecomforts of life we must fabricate them ourselves," Jefferson was writingby 1816. "He, therefore, who is now against domestic manufacture, must befor reducing us either to dependence on that foreign nation, or to be clothed in skins, and to live like wild beasts in dens and caverns. I am proud to say I am not one of these. Experience has taught me that manufactures are now asnecessary to our independence as to our comfort."<br><br>One of the more prolific early boosters of American industry was Tench Coxe, a Philadelphia merchant, former delegate to the Continental Congress, and leading spokesman for the Pennsylvania Society for the Encouragement of Manufactures and the Useful Arts, a group whose founders had included Benjamin Franklin. Although not a member of the Constitutional Convention that gathered in Philadelphia in 1787, he shared with its members copies of his recent speeches and writings urging commerce, manufacturing, and &#x201c;every measure that will give to our newborn states the strength of manhood." Coxe appreciated, as did Jefferson, the fruitfulness of the American countryside, but saw in it not a nation of small farmers; instead he perceived its limitless natural resources, its mighty rivers turning machines and powering industry. Workers at times hardly seemed to figure in Coxe's vision, so substantial was the earth's raw power. "Horses, and the potent elements of fire and water, aided by the faculties of the human mind," he wrote, "are to be, in many instances, our daily laborers. &#x201c;Manufacturing, he enthused, would be a comprehensive economic, social, and moral force able to Consume our native productions...teach us to explore the fossil and vegetable kingdoms...accelerate the improvement of our internal navigation and bring into action the dormant powers of nature and the elements...it will [restore] frugality and industry, those potent antidotes to the vices of mankind; and will give us real independence by rescuing us from the tyranny of foreign fashions and the destructive torrent of luxury<br><br>As evidence that Americans could distinguish themselves as world-class innovators, he spoke of Franklin's discoveries in electricity and of David Rittenhouse's orrery, a clocklike marvel that showed the workings of the solar system. Addressing the concern that burgeoning American industry would attract an unprotected class of workers from across the Atlantic, Coxe reminded the Constitutional Convention that the United States had, if anything, too few people residing in its remote interior. The sprouting of industry, joined with the considerable appeal of a new and virtuous nation already known as an "asylum for mankind," would lure not only workers but also skilled technicians, who would bring with them knowledge of ever more advanced forms of technology. To facilitate this, he proposed that Congress make available quality lands to be given as rewards to foreigners who brought valuable manufacturing concepts to American shores.<br><br>Much as the delegates hoped to produce a Constitution that improved upon Old World methods of government, Coxe insisted, so would the American spirit, applied to manufacturing, remake the habits of industry and labor. This appealing idea-that the purity of America, its virtuous and revolutionary outlook, would democratize and morally sanitize its factory system-resonated deeply within the young nation, and became a guiding first principle of early American industrialization.<br><br>Coxe found an important ally for his ideas in Alexander Hamilton, who in 1791 as secretary of the Treasury submitted to his government the influential treatise Report on the Subject of Manufactures. Hamilton echoed Coxe's view that American industry would be exceptional for being shaped by American ideals, and that both industry and agriculture would thrive as progress in one sphere encouraged productivity in the other. Men would surely leave farming to work in factories, Hamilton conceded, but the activity of the factories would cause more farms to be tilled, and as workers and tillers of the soil came to share in the wealth produced, America herself would become a greater power, the interdependence among its citizens helping to stabilize the country and enable its self-sufficiency. "The extreme embarrassments of the United States during the (Revolutionary War), from an incapacity of supplying themselves, are still matter of keen recollection," Hamilton wrote. "A future war might be expected again to exemplify the mischief sand dangers of (that) situation...unless changed by timely and vigorous exertions. To effect this change as fast as shall be prudent, merits all the attention and all the zeal of our public councils." Hamilton urged his countrymen that industrialization was "the next great work to be accomplished."<br><br>&nbsp;So it was that among optimistic men of government, o business, shipping, and manufacture, there emerged a compelling faith that the new nation might write its own destiny in the industrial realm as assuredly asset had written its own founding documents. But could such a thing as a humane factory system exist? And how would machines, entire rooms of machines, in all their deafening, repetitive authority, impact the lives of the Americans who tended them?</p><h2>The Doctors Book of Home Remedies: Quick Fixes, Clever Techniques, and Uncommon Cures to Get You Feeling Better Fast</h2><p>What do doctors do when they get sick?

Wearing a wide-brimmed hat, carrying a parasol, and shunning the sun are good ideas. Anything to avoid the terrible pain, itching, and swelling of a sunburn.<br><br>If you found yourself outside without your trusty parasol and came away with a nasty sunburn, heed this advice from the experts.<br><br>Apply soothing compresses. Following a burn, the skin is inflamed. Cool it down with compresses dipped in any one of the following substances. If desired, you can direct a fan on the sunburned area to heighten cooling.<br><br>Cold water: Use either plain water from the faucet or add a few ice cubes, says Michael Schreiber, M.D. Dip a cloth into the liquid and lay it over the burn. Repeat every few minutes as the cloth warms. Apply several times a day for a total of 10 to 15 minutes each.<br><br>Aluminum acetate. If itching is intense, says Thomas Gossel, Ph.D., R.Ph., try mixing Domeboro's powder packets (available in drugstores) with water. The aluminum acetate in the powder keeps skin from getting too dry or itchy. Follow package directions.<br><br>Witch hazel. Moisten a cloth with witch hazel, says Fredric Haberman, M.D. This incredible astringent has been shown to have long-lasting anti-inflammatory relief. Apply often for temporary relief. For smaller areas, dip cotton balls into the liquid and gently stroke on.<br><br>Soak the pain away. An alternative to compresses, especially for larger areas, is a cool bath. Add more liquid as needed to keep the water at the proper temperature. Afterward, gently pat your skin dry with a clean towel. Do not rub you skin, or you'll irritate it further. The following substances can reduce pain, itching, and inflammation.<br><br>Vinegar: Mix 1 cup of white or apple cider vinegar into a tub of cool water, says Carl Korn, M.D. A great astringent, it soothes sunburn pain.<br><br>Aveeno powder. If the sunburn involves a large area, use the premeasured packets or add 1/2 cup of Aveeno Bath Treatment, made from oatmeal, to a tub of cool water, says Dr. Schreiber. Soak for 15 to 20 minutes. Aveeno is a well-known remedy for itching.<br><br>Baking Soda. Generously sprinkle baking soda into tepid bath water, suggests Dr. Haberman. Instead of toweling off, let the solution dry on your skin. It is completely nontoxic, and it will soothe the pain.<br><br>Go easy on soap. Soap can dry and irritate burned skin. If you must use soap, says Dr. Gossel, use only a mild brand and rinse it off very well. Do not soak in soapy water. Likewise, stay away from bubble baths.<br><br>Moisturize your skin. Soaks and compresses feel good and give temporary relief, says Rodney Basler, M.D. But they can make your skin feel drier than before if you don't apply moisturizer immediately afterward. Pat yourself dry, then smooth on some bath oil.<br><br>Let it soak in for a minute, then apply a moisturizing cream or lotion, such as Eucerin. Some people like a topical cream called Wibi, which contains a little bit of cooling menthol.<br><br>Chill out. For added relief, try chilling your moisturizer before applying it.<br><br>Seek hydrocortisone relief. Soothe skin irritation and inflammation with a topical lotion, spray, or ointment containing 1 percent hydrocortisone, such as Cortaid or Cortizone-10 says Dr. Basler.<br><br>Say goodbye with aloe. "We're starting to see evidence in medical literature that aloe vera may really help wound healing," says Dr. Basler. Simply break off a leaf and apply the juice. But test a small area first, he cautions, to make sure you're not allergic to aloe.<br><br>Guard against infection. If you have an infection or are worried that one will develop, use an over-the-counter antibacterial ointment such as Polysporin or Neosporin, says Dr. Schreiber.<br><br>Try a local anesthetic. If your burn is mild, an over-the-counter anesthetic can relieve pain and itching, says Dr. Gossel. Look for brands that contain benzocaine, benzyl alcohol, lidocaine, or diphenhydramine hydrochloride. Aerosols are easier to apply than creams or ointments, but never spray them directly onto your face. Instead, put some on a piece of gauze or a cotton pad and pat in on your face to avoid contact with your eyes.<br><br>Try an ice pack. An ice pack can also provide relief if the burn is mild. Wrap it in a damp cloth and hold it over the sunburn. Improvise, if necessary, says Dr. Haberman. "You could even take a bag of frozen peas, for instance, and use that. But make sure to wrap it first so that you're not placing the icy package directly against your skin.."<br><br>Drink up. It's a good idea to drink lots of water to help counteract the drying effects of a sunburn, says Dr. Gossel.<br><br>Eat right. Eat lightly but wisely, Dr. Gossel adds. A balanced diet helps provide the nutrients your skin needs to regenerate itself.<br><br>Raise your legs. If you legs are burned and you feet are swollen, elevate your legs above heart level to help stop the swelling, says Dr. Basler.<br><br>Get a good night's rest. Sleeping on a sunburn can be challenging, but you need rest for your body to recover from the burn. Try sprinkling talcum powder on your sheets to minimize chafing and friction, says Dr. Haberman. A waterbed or air mattress might also help you sleep more easily.<br><br>Be careful with blisters. If blisters develop, you have a pretty bad burn. If they bother you and they cover only a small area, you may carefully drain them, says Dr. Basler. But do not peel the top skin off--you'll have less discomfort and danger of infection if air does not come in contact with sensitive nerve endings.<br><br>To drain the fluid, first sterilize a needle by holding it over a flame. Then puncture the edge of the blister and press gently on the top to let the fluid come out. Do this three times in the first 24 hours, says Dr. Basler. Then leave the blisters alone.<br><br>Beware ice and snow. Don't let your guard down in winter, says Butch Farabee, former assistant superintendent of Montana's Glacier National Park. You can get a fierce burn from the sun's rays reflected off ice and snow. "I've even gotten the inside of my mouth sunburned when hiking up icy hills because I was breathing so hard that my mouth was open," he says. So cover up appropriately and wear sunscreen on all exposed areas.<br><br>Don't make the same mistake twice. After you've gotten burned, it takes 3 to 6 months for your skin to return to normal, says Dr. Schreiber. "When you get a sunburn and the top layer of skin peels off, the newly exposed skin is more sensitive than ever. That means you'll burn even faster than you did before if you're not careful."<br><br>WHEN TO CALL A DOCTOR<br><br>A severe burn can take a lot out of you, says Rodney Basler, M.D. Consult a doctor if you experience nausea, chills, fever, faintness, extensive blistering, general weakness, patches of purple discoloration, or intense itching. Be aware that if the burn seems to be spreading, you could have an infection compounding the problem.<br><br>Do just 1 thing<br><br>Take some aspirin. This old standby can help relieve the pain, itching, and swelling of a mild to moderate burn. "Take two tablets every 4 hours," says Rodney Basler, M.D. The same dosage of Tylenol also would work. Or, if your stomach can tolerate it, you might try ibuprofen every 8 hours. Follow label instructions for dosages.<br><br>If you know you've gotten too much sun, try taking aspirin before the redness appears. "Some doctors recommend 650 milligrams of aspirin soon after sun exposure. Repeat every 4 hours for up to six doses," says Thomas Gossel, Ph.D., R.Ph.<br><br>Cures from the Kitchen<br><br>Common kitchen staples can be great sunburn soothers. Press the following into emergency action.<br><br>Oatmeal. Wrap dry oatmeal in cheesecloth or gauze. Run cool water through it. Discard the oatmeal and soak compresses in the liquid. Apply every 2 to 4 hours.<br><br>Fat-free milk. Mix 1 cup fat-free milk with 4 cups water, then add a few ice cubes. Apply compresses for 15 to 20 minutes; repeat every 2 to 4 hours.<br><br>Cornstarch. Add enough water to cornstarch to make a paste. Apply directly to the sunburn.<br><br>Lettuce. Boil lettuce leaves in water. Strain, then let the liquid cool several hours in the refrigerator. Dip cotton balls into the liquid and gently press or stroke onto irritated skin.<br><br>Yogurt. Apply yogurt to all sunburned areas. Rinse off in a cool shower, then gently pat skin dry.<br><br>Tea bags. If your eyelids are burned, apply tea bags soaked in cool water to decrease swelling and help relieve pain. Tea has tannic acid, which seems to ease sunburn pain.</p><h2>Babar and Father Christmas (Babar Series)</h2><p><b>Every child&#x2019;s favortie elephant, Barbar, returns in this unusual and heartwarming Christmas story by Jean de Brunhoff.</b><br><br> Babar&#x2019;s children have caught wind of a fellow in Man&#x2019;s country named Father Christmas who brings joy and toys to little children. &#x201c;If only we could bring him here,&#x201d; they wish.

In the newest volume in the series, </strong><strong><em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em></strong><strong>, acclaimed historian Richard White offers a fresh and integrated interpretation of Reconstruction and the Gilded Age as</strong> <strong>the seedbed of modern America.</strong><br><br>At the end of the Civil War the leaders and citizens of the victorious North envisioned the country's future as a free-labor republic, with a homogenous citizenry, both black and white. The South and West were to be reconstructed in the image of the North. Thirty years later Americans occupied an unimagined world. The unity that the Civil War supposedly secured had proved ephemeral. The country was larger, richer, and more extensive, but also more diverse. Life spans were shorter, and physical well-being had diminished, due to disease and hazardous working conditions. Independent producers had become wage earners. The country was Catholic and Jewish as well as Protestant, and increasingly urban and industrial. The "dangerous" classes of the very rich and poor expanded, and deep differences -- ethnic, racial, religious, economic, and political -- divided society. The corruption that gave the Gilded Age its name was pervasive. <br><br>These challenges also brought vigorous efforts to secure economic, moral, and cultural reforms. Real change -- technological, cultural, and political -- proliferated from below more than emerging from political leadership. Americans, mining their own traditions and borrowing ideas, produced creative possibilities for overcoming the crises that threatened their country.<br><br>In a work as dramatic and colorful as the era it covers, White narrates the conflicts and paradoxes of these decades of disorienting change and mounting unrest, out of which emerged a modern nation whose characteristics resonate with the present day.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard White</strong> is Margaret Byrne Professor of American History at Stanford University. He is the author of numerous prize-winning books, including <em>Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America</em>, <em>The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region,</em> <em>1650-1815</em>, and <em>"It's Your Misfortune and None of My Own": A New History of the American West</em>. He is a recipient of a MacArthur Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and a Mellon Distinguished Scholar Award, among other awards.<br><br>"Fearless and peerless, Richard White leads us through a transformed and fragmented nation in turmoil, haunted by the slain Abraham Lincoln, where visions of freedom and equality were rapidly vanishing. In the rural South, in the urban North, and out West, from the terribly destitute to the stupendously wealthy, White brings together stories that historians have long told separately, untangling the anger and blame that grew so deeply entrenched in the Gilded Age. How did all this happen? Richard White explains everything." -- Martha Hodes, author of <em>Mourning Lincoln</em> <br><p></p><br>"Richard White has given us a brilliantly imagined narrative of astonishing breadth, thickly peopled with figures from familiar political lions to Lizzie Borden, Dorothy and Toto, that brings to vivid life one of the most challenging periods of American history. His is a twisting, often violent and above all ironic story of a nation finding its way from a time of both tragedy and optimism to one of prodigious wealth and colossal energy, of deepening divisions of class, blood, and ideas, of new meanings of everything from government to geographical space, and of a shaken, tempered faith in the century ahead. This is a masterful performance." -- Elliott West, author of <em>The Last Indian War</em> <br><p></p><br>"Richard White offers a remarkable new synthesis of the decades following the Civil War, showing the myriad ways in which a period about which most modern Americans know too little in fact laid the foundations for the nation we know today. This book will change the ways we think not just about the past, but about the present as well." -- William Cronon, author of <em>Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em> illuminates every key aspect of the industrializing, expanding nation in the final third of the nineteenth century: racial, ecological, legal, political, economic, and cultural. In lucid, witty, and often dramatic prose, Richard White makes sense of them all in a way that powerfully echoes the inequalities and environmental degradation of our own day. Yet he also captures the mighty appeal of the developing capitalist economy that was becoming the envy of the world. This is the best book on the Gilded Age that has ever been written." -- Michael Kazin, author of <em>War Against War: The American Fight for Peace, 1914-1918</em><p></p><br>"This is a marvelous achievement of narrative history by a great historian. Written with immense learning, wit, indignation, fearless judgments, and imagination, the book will stand up for a long time as a new vision of two eras with reputation problems. White masterfully weaves the metaphor of the 'vanished twin' through the book and persuasively makes 'home' a central theme binding all Americans of every class or race: as dream, as reality, as racial and gendered place, and as politics. This is not your grandaddy's Gilded Age, although corruption - lots of it - oozes from the story. It is powerful and readable history that exudes all the 'hallmarks of modernity' we have claimed and soberingly invokes our own grave political moment. What 'vanished' is nothing less than the meaning of Union victory and the world the first Republican party struggled to achieve. White is our Mark Twain with archival authority and footnotes." -- David W. Blight, Yale University<p></p><br>"<em>The Oxford History of the United States</em> continues to surpass expectations with this latest contribution. For many Americans, Reconstruction is still remembered as a period of racial anarchy, political failure, and the humiliation of the defeated South. This volume presents detailed knowledge of what actually happened in the South between 1865 and 1876 and the years that followed. It is sometimes an inspiring but more often deeply shocking story that reveals a nation at its best and worst, when newly freed slaves and idealists, both black and white, struggled to preserve the rights Union armies had won on the battlefield and that Republican members of Congress affirmed in the years after the Civil War." -- Frank J. Williams, President of The Ulysses S. Grant Presidential Library and Association <br><p></p><br>"The conclusion of the Civil War through the 1890s marked the transformation of the US from a rural and agrarian society of free laborers to a modern, urban, industrial nation where wages and possessions replaced liberty and individualism. White's rich, sweeping history chronicles the divide between the Radical Republicans (today's Libertarians) and those who saw the need for governmental protection of individual rights. White seamlessly incorporates political, economic, social, and legal history to show the birth of the modern US. Throughout, he includes fascinating anecdotes that captivate readers. Highly recommended." -- <em>Choice</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em> is a remarkably fresh and innovative way of looking at the Reconstruction and Gilded Age by an academic with unmatched academic credentials. No matter how much you have read on the Reconstruction and the Gilded Age, <em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em> has a lot to offer you. <em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em> should be a required part of any American history syllabus in all universities." -- <em>The Washington Book Review</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Stanford professor Richard White's <em>The Republic for Which It Stands,</em> a sweeping history of the United States from 1865 to 1896 that just published last month. It's 941 pages but beautifully written and a gripping narrative of a tumultuous era. (White was one of my favorite professors at Stanford. I took two of his classes.)" -- <em>Washington Post</em><br><p></p><br>"There is almost nothing about the era that White fails to treat with intelligence and style Richard White has related a decisive part of its history with stamina and skill." -- <em>The New York Times Book Review</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"White's masterful book offers a treasure trove of information about a pivotal time in American history, crafted with a compelling combination of well-written recreations of events and careful analysis based on the latest historical research. <em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em> is the best available guide to the period." -- <em>BookPage</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"Stanford historian White (<em>Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America, 2011</em>) tells this tumultuous story with authority, an eye for detail, and a dash of moral outrage. A noted historian of the West, he covers monetary policy, land use, social history, literature, and biography as he examines America from 1865 to 1896." -- <em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em> is a thorough examination of late 19th-century America. White tracks the building of a nation and the growth of its industrial and economic power with an eye toward those left behind by the changes - a welcome focus at a moment when those being left behind by the equivalent changes of our time have just helped spark profound political upheaval by electing President Trump. And even when his analysis tends toward the negative, progressive view of American history, his detail nevertheless enlightens the reader." -- <em>The National Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this monumental yet highly readable book, Mr. White has given us a panorama of an age that in many ways seems like our own. The volcanic turmoil of the late 19th century did much to shape the world that we live in today, with its creative and destructive cycles of industry, its quickening technological change, its extremes of wealth and poverty, its struggle to impose fairness in the jungle of the marketplace, its tug of war between freedom and regulation in the public interest. '<em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em>' is, in no small part, the story of how we came to be who we are." -- <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"(White) is one of the outstanding historians of his generation. It is difficult to think of many others who can match the range, depth, originality and influence of his writings, which include a prize-winning account of the construction of the transcontinental railroads, an environmental history of the Columbia River Valley, a general history of the American West, and even a memoir of his mother's life as an emigrant from Ireland." -- <em>Times Literary Supplement"</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"In his impressive new book <em>The Republic for Which It Stands</em>, the latest volume in the ongoing 'Oxford History of the United States,' White links the Gilded Age with Reconstruction-the two 'gestated together,' he writes-and, in so doing, casts both in a different light while raising new questions about a nation born in the cauldron of civil war." -- <em>The Nation</em> <br><p></p><br>Winner of the Ellis W.

He is the coauthor of Introduction to the Old Testament as well as many other books and articlesSeveral distinctives set this volume apart from other introductions to the Old Testament: - It is thoroughly evangelical in its perspective. - It emphasizes &#34;special introduction&#34; -- the study of individual books. -It interacts in an irenic spirit with the historical-critical method. - It features high points of research history and representative scholars rather than an exhaustive treatment of past scholarship. - It deals with the meaning of each book, not in isolation but in a canonical context. - It probes the meaning of each book in the setting of its culture. With an eye on understanding the nature of the Old Testament historiography, An Introduction to the Old Testament offers the reader a solid understanding of three key issues: historical background, literary analysis, and theological message.</p><h2>Big Sky (Jackson Brodie, 5)</h2><p><strong>Iconoclastic detective Jackson Brodie returns in a triumphant new novel about secrets, sex, and lies</strong> <br>Jackson Brodie has relocated to a quiet seaside village, in the occasional company of his recalcitrant teenage son and an aging Labrador, both at the discretion of his ex-partner Julia. It's picturesque, but there's something darker lurking behind the scenes.<br>Jackson's current job, gathering proof of an unfaithful husband for his suspicious wife, is fairly standard-issue, but a chance encounter with a desperate man on a crumbling cliff leads him into a sinister network-and back across the path of his old friend Reggie. Old secrets and new lies intersect in this breathtaking novel by one of the most dazzling and surprising writers at work today.<br><br></p><p><strong>Kate Atkinson's</strong> first novel, <em>Behind the Scenes at the Museum</em>, was named England's Whitbread Book of the Year in 1996. Since then, she has written ten more ground-breaking, bestselling books, most recently <em>Transcription</em>. She lives in Edinburgh, Scotland."Atkinson opens "Big Sky" with one perfect page. It's a bit of a red herring, but it couldn't do a better job of throwing the reader off base and commanding instant interest. It's a short chapter called "Eloping," and if you have a way of looking at it, do. It's a prime example of how Atkinson tells a great story, toys with expectations, deceives by omission, blows smoke and also writes like she's your favorite friend. Thank goodness the long Jackson Brodie hiatus is over."&#x2015;<b><i>Janet Maslin,<em> New York Times </em></i></b><br><br>"The novel is brimming with the wit and let-justice-triumph tenacity that led the series to print bestsellerdom and a popular BBC-TV series... There isn't a character here - major or minor - who doesn't sashay resplendently off the page. With Atkinson it's Raymond Chandler meets Jane Austen, and amazingly she makes it all work."&#x2015;<b><i><em>The Washington Post</em>'s Best Summer Thrillers</i></b><br><br>"The bestselling British writer returns to Brodie's world for a fifth time in <i>Big Sky</i>, which finds the hero ensconced in a quaint northern English seaside town, making a living as a private investigator. As is often the case in Atkinson's genre-defying fiction, assignments to track lost cats and unfaithful husbands are never quite what they seem."&#x2015;<b><i><em>TIME</em>, 32 Books You Need to Read this Summer</i></b><br><br>"The plot of "Big Sky" is something of a ramshackle affair, but it hardly matters. Kate Atkinson is a wayward writer, her books are, in the end, uncategorizable. Her Jackson Brodie novels are both more than crime novels - and less. They are sui generis and they, like this one, are enormously enjoyable."&#x2015;<b><i>Katherine A. Powers, <em>Newsday</em></i></b><br><br>"The handsome investigator that Kate Atkinson introduced in 2004's "Case Histories," played by Jason Isaacs on the BBC series, hasn't appeared in a new book since 2011. If you haven't met him yet, this is a fine place to start... Atkinson is so skilled at getting inside people's heads that when she introduces a new character, it's almost impossible to not feel at least a little sympathy for the person... The gangbuster ending flings a pile of spinning plates in the air. They could be picked up in a swath of new directions, including Jackson or not. But I hope he comes back. He's still the empathetic, flawed, country-music-listening detective we first fell for."&#x2015;<b><i> Carolyn Kellogg, <em>The Washington Post</em></i></b><br><br>"The great Atkinson has returned to crime fiction and her well-beloved detective, Jackson Brodie...Atkinson masterfully juggles Brodie's consciousness with that of numerous other characters...You flit in and out of their various viewpoints, but Brodie's - warmhearted, weary, haunted by loss - always feels like coming home... I read this book in a delicious late-night rush; I suspect many of you will too."<br><br>&#x2015;<b><i>Moira Macdonald, <em>Seattle Times</em> <br><br></i></b><br><br>"Atkinson's funny, poignant gem will make you forgive the wait"&#x2015;<b><i><em>People Magazine</em></i></b><br><br>"Kate Atkinson is one of those very rare writers who's a master at absolutely every aspect of the novel-character and plot and voice and language and themes and humor and dialogue and on and on. I love everything about BIG SKY, a giant mosaic of people and stories that fit perfectly together in a complex, beautiful pattern, offering tremendous reading pleasure on every single page."&#x2015;<b><i>Chris Pavone, bestselling author of <i>The Expats</i><br><br></i></b><br><br>"As always in a Kate Atkinson book... the pleasures derive from her mastery as a storyteller, her skillful character development and the beauty of her quirky and poetic prose."&#x2015;<b><i>Associated Press</i></b><br><br>"'A coincidence is just an explanation waiting to happen' is one of Jackson's maxims; it could also serve as an ironic epigram for Atkinson's approach to the mystery genre. A small cast of characters collides and careens in a manner that straddles Greek tragedy and screwball comedy. The humor is sly rather than slapstick, and Atkinson is keenly interested in inner lives and motivations...The deaths and disappearances that Jackson investigates change with every book, but the human heart remains the central mystery.

Much more than a children's story, the narrative is also a lesson on the precarious nature of freedom, a luxury too often taken for granted. Heidi almost loses her liberty as she is ripped away from the tranquility of the mountains to tend to a sick cousin in the city. Happily, all's well that ends well, and the reader is left with only warm, fuzzy thoughts. Spryi's story will never grow wearisome--and this is a very appealing edition. <i>--Naomi Gesinger</i>6 1-hour cassettes</p><h2>Fatima for Today: The Urgent Marian Message of Hope</h2><p>Though the apparitions of Our Lady of Fatima took place almost a hundred years ago, Our Lady&#39;s call to prayer and penance for the salvation of souls and peace in the world is as relevant now as when first delivered to three Portuguese peasant children in 1917.At the peak of the First World War, Our Lady warned of another worldwide conflict, the rise and spread of Communism, and a terrible persecution of the Church unless people repented of their sins and returned to God. She also requested devotion to her Immaculate Heart and a special consecration of Russia.Much of what Our Lady of Fatima said was revealed soon after her appearances, but the third and final secret, which was not a message but a prophetic vision seen by the children, was not unveiled by the Vatican until 2000. Pope John Paul II, who read the third secret while recovering from the attempt upon his life in 1981, believed the vision signified the sufferings the Church had endured in the twentieth century.Because of the prophetic nature of her messages, Our Lady of Fatima has been the subject of much controversy and speculation. In this book, Father Andrew Apostoli carefully analyzes the events that took place in Fatima and clears up lingering questions and doubts about their meaning. He also challenges the reader to hear anew the call of Our Lady to prayer and sacrifice, for the world is ever in need of generous hearts willing to make reparation for those in danger of losing their way to God.</p><p>Fr. Andrew Apostoli, C.F.R., is a widely known and loved teacher and retreat master. A frequent presence on EWTN television, he is an expert on Our Lady of Fatima and Archbishop Fulton Sheen. He is the author of numerous articles and books, including Fatima for Today: The Urgent Marian Message of Hope (Ignatius, 2010).</p><h2>Cosmic Memory: The Story of Atlantis, Lemuria, and the Division of the Sexes</h2><p>In the best tradition of ancient wisdom literature, <i>Cosmic Memory</i> reconstructs, from the akashic record, events that span the time between the origin of the Earth and the beginning of recorded history.

Allen</b></p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy.

Barrett begins with Maria&#x2019;s Nantucket childhood, where Sudyka&#x2019;s gorgeous gouache-and-watercolor starscapes already bleed through the fabric of her reality, shimmering in the ocean waters and along the hems of her dresses. The art often utilizes visual metaphor; dialogue flows across the page in swirling ribbons of text as Maria&#x2019;s father teaches her how to &#x201c;sweep the sky.&#x201d; The language is simple and lyrical, preferring to evoke the wonder of the subject rather than get bogged down in scientific detail, and yet it manages to infuse a healthy dose of education, describing instruments and methods, as well as celestial objects.

Just when she&#39;s about to give up, an elephant shows Mela that kindness is its own reward.

Use this book to open discussions about the importance of being kind to others; why you should never wander away from home without permission; and why it is important not to trust strangers. --Picture Book Depot<br><br>Phumiruk (Maya Lin: Artist-Architect of Light and Lines) takes readers to the country of her birth in an instructive contemporary fable about kindness, set in a village in Northern Thailand. A girl named Mela sets off to explore the nearby banks of the Ping River, refusing to bring along her younger brother. What will you give me if I take you? she asks, but he has nothing. The decision comes back to bite her after she's swept away by the current and winds up far from home. Mela meets a crocodile, leopard, and monkeys, who ask her the same question she asked her brother when she requests their assistance. She offers them her belongings, which they take and then they abandon her. Eventually, an elephant arrives to help and deliver the book s central message that kindness needs no reward. It s not a subtle story, but it s still a potentially useful tool for conversations about generosity, and Chen's digital artwork, rendered in an array of creamy greens, brings the verdant setting to life. --Publisher's Weekly<br><br>Mela is a bold and adventurous girl who thinks nothing of setting off to explore the riverbank on her own. When her brother asks if he can accompany her, she refuses because he has nothing to offer in return. Thus, her journey along the river becomes a cautionary tale. Mela&#x2019;s boat gets trapped, and she finds herself lost and dependent on the jungle creatures to show her some kindness and direct her home. In a predictable parallel, the animals will only help her if she gives them something. Set near the Ping River in Thailand, this story has the trappings of a contemporary folktale, with a lesson about kindness awaiting Mela and the readers. Cheerful illustrations in a palette of glowing jungle colors offset the perils of a child alone in a forest. Mela&#x2019;s predicament is happily resolved by a kindly elephant, and she learns to change her opportunistic ways. An author&#x2019;s note about Thailand provides brief cultural context with explanations about geography, customs, and concepts. --Booklist--</p><h2>Dictionary of Cliches: If You Wonder about the Origins of All Those Old Saws--from First Blush to Bite the Dust--You&#39;ll Find This Book the Cat&#39;s Meow!</h2><p>"The best kind of reference book--one that amuses as it instructs.

How ironic that they&#x2019;re the most vibrant right before they fall and die. Now all we&#x2019;re left with is big piles of wet drabness and this bone-chilling weather.<br><br>This is how so many patients feel, I thought. One moment your life is going along beautifully, and the next your doctor walks in with your tests in his or her hand and says, &#x201c;I have bad news.&#x201d;<br><br>Once you or someone you love receives that diagnosis, your lives will never be the same. A good friend, diagnosed with cancer, told me, &#x201c;The disease took away life&#x2019;s innocence. I always feel like there&#x2019;s a stranger lurking in the shadows now, ready to jump out and do me harm again. The shadow person&#x2014;that negative presence&#x2014;is always there.&#x201d;<br><br>I thought of my friend and the end of innocence as I steered my car past the leaf piles toward the only stretch of visible curb in a neighborhood of wide lawns and large colonial-style homes. Then I quietly reviewed the intake information sheet on the new patient I was about to meet.<br><br>Jake<br><br>Jake was barely sixty years old, diagnosed with pancreatic cancer just three months before, and already terminally ill. He and his wife of many years had two married children, both living nearby, both with babies of their own. How sad, I thought: just as life was getting easier&#x2014;kids launched, retirement around the corner, time to travel and enjoy the benefits of all those years of hard work, grandbabies to spoil&#x2014;this happened. How unfair!<br><br>I suspected that this family, like so many others I meet, had held off calling hospice for as long as possible, and now they were near crisis. As I climbed the steps to the front door, I noticed a woman glancing through the bay window of the living room. Was this Jake&#x2019;s wife, Julie? I rang the bell and sensed her presence behind the front door, but it was a long minute before she opened it, her face puffy from crying.<br><br>Even after so many years as a hospice nurse, I&#x2019;m still in awe of the raw courage it takes to open the door and let someone like me in for the first time. Most of the patients and families that I work with have clung to the hope of a miracle, a medical breakthrough, or even a misdiagnosis until the eleventh hour. My presence means that the end is unavoidable. Those who have acknowledged the truth often feel that the limited time they have left together is private and fear that my visits will be an intrusion. I know that everything I represent is frightening. Nobody ever wants to have to deal with me. Yet I knock on front doors again and again because in my heart I know I can make these last weeks or months better and more meaningful.<br><br>Julie introduced herself and escorted me into a sun-filled kitchen decorated with blue Delft tiles.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me about your husband,&#x201d; I said to Julie as we sat down at the kitchen table.<br><br>It always interests me what people do with that question. It&#x2019;s like asking someone you meet, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s going on in your life?&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;How are you?&#x201d; The first question allows for real information to be shared; the second almost always elicits a perfunctory response. My first goal when I visit a new patient and his or her family is to connect in a genuine way. I need to know their focus, concerns, and fears. Julie&#x2019;s answer would tell me these things.<br><br>Julie gave me a list of her husband&#x2019;s symptoms and problems, and details of the treatments he had undergone. They had been in and out of hospitals for tests. They had traveled out of state to major cancer centers for second, third, and fourth opinions. The treatments they had chosen quickly overwhelmed Jake and had to be discontinued. Julie described a regimen that sounded truly hellish. And now they were finally back at home and having to deal with me. They were out of hope and running out of time. I took a deep breath, now knowing what direction to take. Julie was totally focused on the physical part of Jake&#x2019;s illness, so that&#x2019;s where we would start.<br><br>&#x201c;I can see how much you and your husband have gone through in the past months. You must be physically and emotionally exhausted. I&#x2019;m sure I&#x2019;ll have some very specific suggestions for better relief of his physical problems, but what else can I do today to help you?&#x201d;<br><br>Julie&#x2019;s face quivered as she attempted to keep her composure. I wanted to reach across the table and put my hand on her arm to comfort her. My concern must have showed, because she suddenly drew herself up and almost fiercely said, &#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t be nice to me! I feel like I&#x2019;m made of bits of paper that are barely held together. The slightest kindness and I will fall apart and blow away. I must be strong for him. He&#x2019;s depending on me. I don&#x2019;t know how to do this! I need strength, not sympathy. I need tools, not tissues. I&#x2019;m terrified! Help me!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That is exactly why I am here,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Of course you don&#x2019;t know how to do it. No wonder you&#x2019;re terrified. Your husband&#x2019;s illness is being carried in his body, but its devastation is rippling through his life, your life, and the lives of your children and grandchildren, his colleagues, and your neighbors and friends. Everyone feels the turmoil. Hearts start breaking the moment the word incurable is uttered. What&#x2019;s vitally important is to focus on what you can do, rather than on what has been done and failed or how little time is left.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just so overwhelming,&#x201d; Julie said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what I need anymore.&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;ve heard these words so many times&#x2014;the first words on the journey of dying. I reassured Julie. &#x201c;I can tell you&#x2019;ve done a great job of staying involved and informed at every stage,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I am here to ensure that you have the very best possible care from the experts you need for each problem your husband might have or develop. I&#x2019;m also here to help everyone else in the family deal with this life-changing event in as positive a way as possible. I will coordinate the people who will be taking care of all of you. This is a team that will include your doctor, a social worker, a chaplain, a nursing assistant, volunteers, a grief counselor, a nutritionist, a physical therapist, and me, your nurse. So not for one moment do I want you to think that you are in this alone, because you&#x2019;re not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But the doctors say there&#x2019;s nothing more we can do. He&#x2019;s going to die,&#x201d; Julie sobbed.<br><br>&#x201c;How frightening and heartbreaking it must have been to hear that news,&#x201d; I replied. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s a great deal we can do. We have highly effective and easy ways of keeping your husband as comfortable and alert as possible. We can help him&#x2014;and you&#x2014;live as fully as possible every day he has left. This can be a very creative, intimate, and loving time for both of you&#x2014;a time for making and celebrating memories that will last forever in your hearts. I am here to help you both be less frightened and more in charge. We can do this together!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I just want things to be the way they were,&#x201d; said Julie. &#x201c;This is no way to live.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This has changed your life,&#x201d; I replied, &#x201c;but it need not destroy it. I suspect that each chapter of your husband&#x2019;s life story has been an important and rich one. I want to help you write the last chapter in a way that is a fitting tribute to him and the life you have created together. This is our chance to show him that it has mattered that he has been on this earth. I know you want to show him how important he has been to you.&#x201d;<br><br>Julie&#x2019;s eyes widened. I could see her focus shift, at least for a moment, away from the fear and the sense of burden that had been so much a part of Jake&#x2019;s physical journey. When I meet new patients and their families, as early as possible I try to reframe the situation, to help people understand the loving and nurturing emotional journey that dying also includes. For a moment Julie seemed to be lighter, to grasp this possibility, but then her shoulders slumped again.<br><br>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s been so withdrawn, uncommunicative, almost sullen,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;And before that he was angry, snapping and snarling. Who could blame him? I think he just couldn&#x2019;t accept what was happening. That&#x2019;s why it took us so long to call for help,&#x201d; Julie said sadly.<br><br>&#x201c;Anger and denial are two normal responses to terrible news,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You may have heard of the psychologist Dr. Elisabeth K�bler-Ross, who changed the way we all look at the last stage of life with her book On Death and Dying. In it she describes five stages that dying people often go through: from denial, anger, and bargaining to depression and finally acceptance. These stages aren&#x2019;t necessarily a linear process; sometimes you can hear a seriously ill person touch on several during a single conversation. Not everyone experiences all of them, but I&#x2019;ve learned that most people seem to experience some. This is true for the family as well as the patient.<br><br>&#x201c;Denial is my personal favorite,&#x201d; I went on. &#x201c;I try to use it in my own life as much as I can!&#x201d; I was pleased to see a half smile on Julie&#x2019;s face as she relaxed a bit. &#x201c;Denial is a wonderfully strong crutch that supports a person who is not yet emotionally ready to face what&#x2019;s happening all at once. If denial isn&#x2019;t causing any harm, let it be, unless you have something stronger to put in its place.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve already described anger. That&#x2019;s an easy stage to see and understand,&#x201d; I continued. &#x201c;Bargaining is often very private. A man may promise that he&#x2019;ll work with the handicapped if he is cured, or a woman might resolve to go to church regularly if she can see her children grow up. We are usually not aware of someone else&#x2019;s bargaining. And then there are the stages of depression and, finally, acceptance.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, I would say that Jake has been depressed recently.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Let me go meet him. I&#x2019;ll check him and see if there&#x2019;s something we can do about that.&#x201d;<br><br>I went to Jake, whose den had become his sickroom so that he wouldn&#x2019;t have to go up and down the stairs. It was warm and inviting, lined with books. A hospital bed was set up in front of the fireplace. Jake was very foggy, in that drifty, dreamy state that pancreatic cancer often induces when it has spread to the liver.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve met your lovely wife,&#x201d; I said, biding my time, trying to help him lift himself out of the fog. &#x201c;This is a beautiful house.&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes gradually became more focused and alert. I began to gently question him about how he was feeling and what concerned him. His voice was weak and wavering and his responses seemed dull and flat&#x2014;not unusual for someone with depression. I asked what worried him most.<br><br>&#x201c;I think this is too much for Julie,&#x201d; he said despondently. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how she&#x2019;ll manage to take care of me. It&#x2019;s too much. It&#x2019;ll kill her! Maybe it would be better for me to go to a nursing home.&#x201d;<br><br>Jake&#x2019;s fear was not so much about his own illness and death as it was about his wife&#x2019;s welfare. It moved me that he was willing to sacrifice staying in his own home to help her.</p><h2>Quick &amp; Easy Low-Carb Cookbook: Everyday Recipes for Ketogenic, Low-Sugar, or Cutting Back on Carbs</h2><p>Whether you re eating <b>paleo, ketogenic, glutenfree,or sugar-free</b>, George's recipes are sure to fit your dietary needs.

Socialism Sucks!</b><br> <br> Apparently we do. Because today millions of Americans&#x2014;young and old&#x2014;are flocking to the socialist banner and chanting, &#x201c;What do we want?

No, we&#x2019;ve seen it tried over and over again with catastrophic consequences.<br> <br> Luckily, two semi-sober economists have toured the socialist world so you don&#x2019;t have to. And they&#x2019;ve come back with this stunning report: Socialism Sucks!<br> <br> Along the way, you&#x2019;ll learn:<br> <br> � Why the so-called Swedish model might be attractive, but sure isn&#x2019;t socialism (Sweden is capitalism with a big welfare state)<br> <br> � How socialist Venezuela went from being the toast of liberals everywhere&#x2014;Viva Venezuela!&#x2014;to being just toast<br> <br> � Why you never see new cars in Cuba<br> <br> � Why no one forgets to turn out the lights in North Korea (hint: there aren&#x2019;t any)<br> <br> � Why American socialists have no idea what socialism really is<br> <br> How hard it is to find good beer&#x2014;or sometimes any beer at all&#x2014;in socialist countries<br> <br> Irreverent but honest economists Robert Lawson and Benjamin Powell have all the data&#x2014;and even more important, the firsthand global experience&#x2014;to affirm that socialism fails to deliver on any of the utopian promises it makes and instead is very bad for your economic (and other) health.

A down-to-earth, almost fable-like lesson showing socialism's failures for all the world to see. And it even has some sidesplitting hilarity thrown in.

Jean&#39;s loose, expressive paintings are filled with colour and personality, embracing a range of subjects that includes flowers, animals, people and places, all influenced by the countries and cities she&#39;s lived in and the people she&#39;s met during her life. This beautiful book contains easy-to-follow and inspiring introductory sections such as an artists treasure chest and the colour gym, offering practical guidance and in-depth exercises in an innovative and accessible way, and the numerous examples of Jeans work will inspire and encourage novice as well as experienced artists. After this introductory section, the book shows the reader how to put the skills they&#39;ve learned into practice with gorgeous step-by-step projects packed full of expert tips and advice, encouraging them to move forward and develop their own style of working. Like her painting, Jean&#39;s writing is filled with passion and enthusiasm, transporting the reader through a world of watercolour that will not fail to excite and inspire.</p><p>A member of the Society for Women Artists (SWA), international watercolourist Jean Haines is well-known for her love of her chosen medium. Having lived and travelled in many countries, this popular artist has had the opportunity to develop her skills whilst under the influence of masters from many countries, including Asia, the Middle East and Europe. She studied brush control while living in China and this had the greatest impact on her style. Later, when working with artists from India and Pakistan, she became inspired by the vibrant colours they used. The combination of East meets West in Jeans style is to be enjoyed. The magical free flow of water and colour straight on to a blank working surface (with no initial drawing) creates amazing results, often leaving her audience breathless with delight. Her paintings can be found in homes all over the world and in 2009 she won the Anthony J Lester Award during the SWA Annual Exhibition, where her work was likened to Joseph Crawhalls of the famous Glasgow Boys group of artists. She regularly writes for art magazines and exhibits in a number of galleries. Her hugely successful workshops are held regularly in the UK, and in 2014 she visited Australia for a Book Signing and Workshop Tour. In 2015 she will be visiting California, New York and St Louis in the USA to hold workshops and launch her new book &#39;Jean Haines&#39; Watercolour World&#39;. Jean lives in Crookham Village, Hampshire.Summer 2015 Following the success of her previous book, Atmospheric Watercolours, Jean Haines second book brings us her world of watercolour. In the introduction Jean describes how she wants the book to read as an adventure &#39;an incredible exploration of the world of watercolour&#39;. Rather than simply showing you how to paint in watercolour step by step (which of course she does do) she intednds to motiv ate a reaction in you to look around you and capture that response in the medium of watercolour. Opening chapters deal with materials - with some demonstrations along the way, before moving on to colour and texture, building your confidence then putting it all together to create more complex work. Detailed step by step demonstrations follow, including painting a cat, portraits, landscapes and cityscapes. There are plenty of tips and motivational exercises to keep you inspired on your journey * Leisure Painter, The * July 2015 Having got all 3 of Jean&#39;s books and reviewed Atmospheric Watercolours I took a different approach with this one, savouring it (I tried to savour the others too but excitement made me gulp them down as quickly as possible, not always the best way though they are books to revisit time and time again!!) taking my time and enjoying every word, paragraph and chapter. It isn&#39;t easy to paint in a loose way and even harder to teach it and once again Jean does a truly fabulous job of bringing her style of painting to the masses!! The illustrations are simply beautiful, full of life and colour and in fact this book concentrates very much on colour describing Jean&#39;s own perspective and view of how we should be excited and inspired by all the colours available in today&#39;s market. Music to my ears as I also love colour so am obviously in very good company!! To see this review and blog in full visit... http://judithfarnworthart.blogspot.co.uk/2015/05/book-review-of-jean-haines-world-of.html * judithfarnworthart.blogspot.co.uk * May 2015 Well, this one has a brave title! It takes the gamble that you known who Jean Haines is, as there&#39;s no other clue to the content,. But then, you probably do. Jean has established a reputation in the last few years as one of the most charismatic exponents of loose watercolour. Her ability to convey not just the look but the feel of a subject with just a few washes and well chosen colours has gained her many fans. And, in truth, this isn&#39;t a book you can pin down in any other way. This isn&#39;t exactly a how-to manual, although there are plenty of exercises, demonstrations, hints and tips, but more of a guide to what waterclour can do if you give its head. It&#39;s quite a wild ride a lot of the time, but also an exhilarating one. This is one of those books which is hard to describe as it&#39;s really something you have to experience yourself. However, if you&#39;re a fan of Jean&#39;s work, or you like the idea of loose watercolours and want to explore further with a little guidance, this is one for you. There&#39;s a sense of dynamism, presence and movement throughout that&#39;s a bit like walking on a tightrope. As long as you don&#39;t think too hard or look down it will be OK. Jean manages it with aplomb and she&#39;ll help you get there too. * Paint * May 2015 In this beautiful inspiring book, Jean Haines takes you on an exciting journey through her world of water-colour painting. She provides practical advice and guidance for artists of all abilities using clearly written text, step-by-step studies and numerous examples of her work, all delivered with the same passion and her enthusiasm that characterise her painting and her life. * Craft Business * Issue 111 Jean Haines is most at home with natural subjects - animals, birds, flowers and plants, though people, landscapes and buildings find their way into her work as well. The word &#39;atmospheric&#39; could have been coined for her style of painting, which is less representational than impressionistic. Jean has one of the loosest styles around and she&#39;s not one for minute detail, so the viewer has to be guided to what they&#39;re seeing, rather than shown. It&#39;s something that comes with confidence and she is excellent at showing you how she works and how you can achieve the same effects. By just hinting at forms and shapes, Jean brings an incredible sense of presence and movement to her paintings - those people are too busy going about their daily business to stop and be painted, that kingfisher is going to fly off that branch in a flash any second. It&#39;s a tour de force of the properties of colour and water combined and an amazing and captivating ride all the way. * SAA * May 2015 Jean Haines&#39; luminous, light infused watercolors are a looser, freer style of painting influenced by Chinese brushwork. Try your hand at this style with this accessible book on watercolor painting. The first part of the book charts her change from botanical art to landscapes and beyond, and her views on choosing colors and other art materials. This book does not merely tell you what you ought to buy but explains why the artist uses these things and how she does it, making it a very personal look at watercolor painting. Then follow lessons on brushwork taught through a variety of short paintings and a &#34;watercolor workout&#34;, a &#34;color gym&#34; with warm up exercises and more to get you into the mood. These are described in this way to show how to paint in this style, with lots of washes and loose, dreamy textures and images. What then follows is not just a section of isolated projects but an in-depth look at how Ms Haines approaches each one, complete with steps so you can have a go too. It is certainly an innovative way of working, often using unconventional items like string and plastic to get the right look. Each project however small is packed with useful tips, and anybody having a try is sure to start looking at watercolors in a whole new way. This is a very personal and innovative look at painting which manages to not only convey how the artist does it but teach it as well. * Myshelf.com * August 2015 A book that relies totally on the author&#39;s name for a hint of the content is either brave or supremely sure of itself. In this case Jean Haines is so well known for her loose atmospheric watercolours that the risk is worth it. This is a book that knows exactly what it&#39;s about by an artist who is an absolute master of her medium and technique. Jean explores every corner of water and of colour. She uses the very loosest of washes, rarely depicts detail, instead suggesting it subtly and confidently. The viewer is led towards, what they should see rather than merely shown it. If you love loose, impressionistic watercolour this is an absolute treat. * Artist, The *</p><h2>The Night Country: A Hazel Wood Novel (The Hazel Wood, 2)</h2><p><p><b>The highly anticipated sequel to Melissa Albert&#x2019;s beloved, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling debut <i>The Hazel Wood</i>!</b></p><p>In <i>The Night Country</i>, Alice Proserpine dives back into a menacing, mesmerizing world of dark fairy tales and hidden doors.

Kemal and Sibel, children of two prominent families, are about to become engaged. But when Kemal encounters F�sun, a beautiful shopgirl and a distant relation, he becomes enthralled. And once they violate the code of virginity, a rift begins to open between Kemal and the world of the Westernized Istanbul bourgeoisie. In his pursuit of F�sun over the next eight years, Kemal becomes a compulsive collector of objects that chronicle his lovelorn progress&#x2014;amassing a museum that is both a map of a society and of his heart. Orhan Pamuk&#x2019;s first novel since winning the Nobel Prize is a stirring exploration of the nature of romance.</p></p><p><b>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2009</b>: The story of Kemal, the half-hearted industrialist who is the hero of <i>The Museum of Innocence</i>, Orhan Pamuk's first novel since he won the Nobel Prize for Literature, is a deeply private one, built around an often inexplicable obsession that he attempts to justify to the reader. In honor of F�sun, the poor, beautiful cousin he had a short affair with when he was 30 and engaged to another, he has hoarded a museum of relics, both of their time together and of the much longer time when, like Gatsby drawn by the green light on Daisy's dock, he hovered at the edge of her life, held in check (but yet held nearby) by the proprieties of Turkish society. From Kemal's passion Pamuk constructs a masterful meditation on time, desire, and possession, saturated with the details of the city of Pamuk's youth: the brand names, the film stars, the streets, the intricate social relations between classes and between modernity and tradition. It's as if the museum of the title was built in honor not of F�sun but of Istanbul, circa 1975. <i>--Tom Nissley</i><p><b>Orhan Pamuk </b>won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2006.

Mix and match the designs from each chapter to artfully quilt 30 traditional blocks, borders, sashing, and more! This must-have reference includes an inspiring gallery of finished quilts, tips for domestic and longarm quilters, and complete instructions for a table runner project to hone your skills.</p><p>Amanda Murphy discovered quilting after a career as a graphic designer and art director. She markets quilt patterns under the Amanda Murphy Design label and is also a popular quilting author, fabric designer, a Craftsy quilting teacher, and a BERNINA Artisan. She lives in North Carolina. amandamurphydesign.comThe first thing I noticed about this book is that it is spiral bound, and so has been produced with the intention that it can be used for reference whilst sewing. It is packed full of information and designs, containing 16 all over quilting patterns that are broken down to create 155 different block, sashing and border designs. Each one is clearly illustrated, so even a beginner can learn how to approach a simple block, and fill it with what looks like a complex quilting design. This is a book I would buy not only for beginners, but for friends with more quilting experience as it both informs and inspires you to try new things in your approach to free-motion quilting, The dedication sums up the book nicely by saying, 'To everyone who has ever looked at a quilt top and wondered where to begin.' If you are considering free=motion quilting then this is an ideal book to add to your sewing library.

Free-Motion Quilting Idea Book by Amanda Murphy pairs unique free-motion designs with 30 well-loved quilt blocks. Pick and choose elements from each chapter (borders, sashing, motifs, and more) for an artful finish! (<i>McCall's Quilting, January/February 2016</i>)<br><br>After you put so much time and effort into design and piecing a quilt top it's OK to look at the finished work and think, &#x201c;Now, how in the world am I going to quilt this?!&#x201d; That's where Amanda Murphy comes in. For those free-motion on our own sewing machines or on a longarm, Amanda has created more than 150 block ideas to get your quilting started. The small book feels more like a workbook, guiding you through a creative brainstorm to figure out what works best for your quilt top. All the well-known quilt block designs are included, from log cabins to half-square triangles. As someone who is newer to longarm quilting, this book has become a great resource for helping me finish my quilting projects. (Lish Dorset <i>lishdorset.com, 12/8/15</i>)<br><br>These are purely designs, there are no instructions for quilting techniques. All the designs were sewn on a domestic machine but they could be used on a longarm machine. The important rule is &#x2018;Always stitch in the ditch over the entire quilt first'. A series of very small diagrams show all-over designs. Black lines show the progression from the first stages but no starting or finishing points are indicated. 30 blocks are each heavily quilted in several different styles, with stage by stage diagrams. There are also designs for sashing and borders.

Now, Silver RavenWolf, one of the most well-known Wiccans today and the mother of four young Witches, gives teens their own handbook on what it takes and what it means to be a Witch. Humorous and compassionate, <em>Teen Witch</em> gives practical advice for dealing with everyday life in a magickal way.</p></p><p>Okay, so the cover is a little hokey, but it's what's inside that counts, right? Well, Silver RavenWolf has stuffed <i>Teen Witch</i> with enough basic material on Wicca to give anyone a good start to understanding the craft. As the title implies, this book is geared for teens, addressing the truths and myths about witchcraft in light of the issues that teens face, from school to parents to peer pressure. Precocious readers may feel that RavenWolf is talking down to them at times, but keep in mind that this book addresses a broad age group, and Mama Silver (as she is often called) does an admirable job of presenting this information in a manner to which younger readers can relate, while still meeting the needs of the high-school senior. <i>Teen Witch</i> may not be the ultimate "How to be a Witch" guide, and anyone who thinks RavenWolf is trying to write one has missed her whole point. No single book could stake a valid claim to that title.<p> What <i>Teen Witch</i> offers is an easy-to-grasp introduction to the Craft that answers the basic questions about what being a witch is really all about, and RavenWolf provides a long list of follow-up material for anyone who feels that witchcraft might be the path he or she wants to follow. Writing a book for teenagers about any religion is a tricky prospect, but Mama Silver tackles the problem of discussing an ancient path that has suffered a long history of persecution and negative stereotypes in a way that doesn't step on anyone's toes and shouldn't offend the religious sensibilities of anyone with a mind open to the truth. <i>--Brian Patterson</i></p>The modern Wiccan community is now entering its third, and sometimes fourth, generation. But until now there have been no books specifically designed for teens. The growing number of children in Pagan households, as well as teenagers' growing interest in Witchcraft, meant that somebody had to fill this need. And I couldn't be happier that the person who did this was a mother of teenage daughters, Silver RavenWolf. <br> <br>There are two reasons for this. First, because she's around teens, she knows how to talk with them and what their interests are. The spells she includes have relate to teenage problems: finding peace at home, getting new friends, raising self-esteem. The tools for the spells are all within a teen's budget. They include such common items as eggs or potatoes, or even just a pen and paper. They'll be learning about real Witchcraft in a way that is easy, fun, and safe. <br> <br>Second, because she is a mother herself, she says the kind of things that teens need to hear. For example: drugs and alcohol don't go with magick; a ritual can help build your confidence so you can remember answers for tests (but you still must study so you know the answers to put down; "Witches do not work magick to harm others and we know that no real power lies in evil." There's even a spell to help keep Internet stalkers away. <br> <br>This book is filled with everything a teen needs to know to start practicing Witchcraft. It also provides guidance so that teens can continue with their studies of Wicca. Without hesitation I can recommend <i>Teen Witch </i>as the first book any parent could give to their teen interested in the Craft. I also recommend it to any teen who wants to learn what real Wicca is all about. <br> <br></p><h2>End of the Drive: A Novel (Sacketts)</h2><p>BEST OF THE WEST<br> &nbsp;<br> A veteran trail driver, who has survived thundering stampedes and Comanche raids, discovers there&#x2019;s nothing so dangerous as courting a beautiful woman. . . . <br><br>A brutally beaten homesteader crawls off to die&#x2014;only to stumble upon an ancient talisman that restores his will to live. . . . <br><br>This treasure trove of stories captures the grit, grandeur, and the glory of the men and women who wielded pistol and plow, Bible and branding iron to tame a wild country.

Commentaries from scholars and rabbis, mostly late 20th century, but also from novelists, poets, political leaders, and others. This book is for the family that wants to enhance their seder by bringing in ideas that will make the evening rich, thought-provoking, and fun for all. Many items for younger and older children are sprinkled throughout the book.</p><p>The authors are a father and son team who have shared 26 seders. Noam, an American Jew, and Mishael, an Israeli, both study and teach at the Shalom Hartman Institute. This haggadah combines the experience of Mishael&#39;s bestselling Israeli haggadah, Halaila Hazeh (2004) and Noam&#39;s classic A Different Night (1997) that have made seders more participatory for hundreds of thousands.Noam Zion and now his children are becoming a cottage industry for do-it-yourself Jewish holidays and rituals. Noam and his son Mishael Zion offer a Haggadah with so many sources, stories, quotes, illustrations, poetry, and commentary. This guarantees a night of lively exchanges and Jewish and contemporary meaning. A Night to Remember: The Haggadah of Contemporary Voices is yet another example of the Jewish Renaissance and ritual creativity. It shows the power of cultural dialogue between Israel and America. The beauty of this Haggadah is that you can use it as the family Haggadah, or as an incredibly rich resource to enhance the traditional or modern Haggadot of your choice. In any event, serious Seder leaders from all the denominations will sit down with A Night to Remember days before the Seder to pick and choose what to read and what to do this night, as different than last Seder. I warmly recommend this publication. Not only is it a welcome addition to any Jewish table and library, it is an invaluable tool for promoting Jewish meaning and spirit in an age where we need this multi-vocal, richly textured, inspiring Haggadah. --Rabbi Naamah Kelman, Hebrew Union College Jerusalem Campus, Director of Year in Israel program and Educational Initiatives<br><br>A Night to Remember is a necessary, fresh, and wonderful addition to the world of haggadot. Beautifully conceived and designed, it enlists contemporary voices in original ways to illuminate Judaism's oldest and most widely observed rituals. --Rabbi Joseph Telushkin, author, A Code of Jewish Ethics: You Shall be Holy; and Jewish Literacy.<br><br>Pesach is the holiday that most concretely represents and celebrates the essence of Jewish identity. The beautiful Exodus story, the elaborate rituals, the emphasis on family, community, and history -- all these combine on Seder night to provide a powerful, affirmative Jewish experience. Except, of course, when they don't. All too typically, the Seder -- in Israel and America both -- is more or less a Jewish Thanksgiving, a warm get-together with little spiritual or intellectual content. The Haggadah is recited quickly and by rote, with the smells of home cooking acting as an added incentive to speed-read the ancient text, or (forgive the pun) pass over it entirely. In my view, the publication of Zion family s new "A Night to Remember: The Haggadah of Contemporary Voices" will go a long way to remedy all that. Its contents are so rich, wide-ranging, and pluralistic -- songs and poems, games and quizzes, historical asides and rabbinic interpretations -- that any Jew who is curious about Jewish life cannot fail to be fascinated. Its practical commentary on the Seder service clarifies the evening's rituals. At the same time, passages that elaborate upon the spiritual or mystical significance of such familiar Jewish practices as lighting holiday candles or eating matzah will speak to young globe-trotting Jews who have found other traditions more intriguing than their own. I was especially impressed by the treatment of the Four Sons and Four Daughters, which uses both text and illustration to explore multiple interpretations of this famous parable. Overall, the editors have succeeded admirably in linking the biblical images and philosophical concerns of the Haggadah to modern culture and the exigencies of Jewish life. I've learned something new from every page of A Night to Remember: The Haggadah of Contemporary Voices. In fact, I plan to use it myself when leading this year's Seder. --Stuart Schoffman, Associate Editor, Jerusalem Report, Senior Fellow Shalom Hartman Institute</p><h2>The Collected Stories (FSG Classics)</h2><p><p>This reissue of Grace Paley's classic collection&#x2015;a finalist for the National Book Award&#x2015;demonstrates her rich use of language as well as her extraordinary insight into and compassion for her characters, moving from the hilarious to the tragic and back again. Whether writing about the love (and conflict) between parents and children or between husband and wife, or about the struggles of aging single mothers or disheartened political organizers to make sense of the world, she brings the same unerring ear for the rhythm of life as it is actually lived.</p><p><i>The Collected Stories</i> is a 1994 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction.</p></p><p><p>Born in the Bronx in 1922, <b>Grace Paley</b> was a renowned writer and activist. Her <i>Collected Stories</i> was a finalist for both the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. Her other collections include <i>Enormous Changes at the Last Minute</i> and <i>Just As I Thought</i>. She died in Vermont on August 22, 2007.</p>Paley is a member of that select breed of writers who become masters of the short story and resist the pressure to produce a novel. This volume gathers together more than 30 years' worth of stellar stories from Paley's best-known collections, <i>The Little Disturbances of Man</i> (1959), <i>Enormous Changes at the Last Minute</i> (1974), and <i>Later the Same Day</i> (1985). This rich compilation presents us with the full spectrum of Paley's voices as well as her observations and interpretations of urban family life and a society that thrives on oppression. An outspoken pacifist, feminist, and self-described "cooperative anarchist," Paley can no more keep her political beliefs out of her fiction than a plant can keep from releasing oxygen into the atmosphere, but the story always comes first. Her cast of stubborn, opinionated, earthy, smart, sassy, and robust characters demand it. Paley writes just as effectively from a man's point of view as a woman's, discerning the ironies of everyone's predicaments, but she writes most poignantly about the frustrations of women stuck in the rigidity of gender roles. Paley's people either have moxie, or tremendous endurance. They're frank about lust, angry about money, and always ready for a good argument. These staccato tales of the city capture of the essence of the changes each decade has brought, while also dramatizing the continuity of human emotions. And Paley can just knock us flat with the force of her spirited language. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Born to Run</h2><p>The revelatory and wildly bestselling memoir by legendary rock star Bruce Springsteen: &#x201c;Glorious...a philosophically rich ramble through a rock &#x2019;n roll life...It&#x2019;s the lyric he was born to write&#x201d; (<i>USA TODAY</i>, 4 out of 4 stars).<br><br>Over the past seven years, Bruce Springsteen has privately devoted himself to writing the story of his life. The result is &#x201c;an utterly unique, endlessly exhilarating, last-chance-power-drive of a memoir&#x201d; (<i>Rolling Stone</i>) that offers the same honesty, humor, and originality found in his songs.<br> <br>He describes growing up Catholic in Freehold, New Jersey, amid the poetry, danger, and darkness that fueled his imagination, leading up to the moment he refers to as &#x201c;The Big Bang&#x201d;: seeing Elvis Presley&#x2019;s debut on <i>The Ed Sullivan Show</i>. He vividly recounts his relentless drive to become a musician, his early days as a bar band king in Asbury Park, and the rise of the E Street Band. With disarming candor, he also tells for the first time the story of the personal struggles that inspired his best work.<br> <br>Rarely has a performer told his own story with such force and sweep.

This book is a &#x201c;a virtuoso performance, the 508-page equivalent to one of Springsteen and the E Street Band's famous four-hour concerts: Nothing is left onstage, and diehard fans and first-timers alike depart for home sated and yet somehow already aching for more&#x201d; (NPR).</p><p>Bruce Springsteen has been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the New Jersey Hall of Fame. He is the recipient of twenty Grammy Awards, the Academy Award, and the Kennedy Center Honors.&nbsp;He lives in New Jersey with his family.Foreword<br> &nbsp;<br> I come from a boardwalk town where almost everything is tinged with a bit of fraud. So am I. By twenty, no race-car-driving rebel, I was a guitar player on the streets of Asbury Park and already a member in good standing amongst those who &#x201c;lie&#x201d; in service of the truth . . . artists, with a small &#x201c;a.&#x201d; But I held four clean aces. I had youth, almost a decade of hard-core bar band experience, a good group of homegrown musicians who were attuned to my performance style and a story to tell.<br><br> This book is both a continuation of that story and a search into its origins. I&#x2019;ve taken as my parameters the events in my life I believe shaped that story and my performance work. One of the questions I&#x2019;m asked over and over again by fans on the street is &#x201c;How do you do it?&#x201d; In the following pages I will try to shed a little light on how and, more important, why.<br><br> DNA, natural ability, study of craft, development of and devotion to an aesthetic philosophy, naked desire for . . . fame? . . . love? . . . admiration? . . . attention? . . . women? . . . sex? . . . and oh, yeah . . . a buck. Then . . . if you want to take it <i>all </i>the way out to the end of the night, a furious fire in the hole that just . . . don&#x2019;t . . . quit . . . burning.<br><br> These are some of the elements that will come in handy should you come face-to-face with eighty thousand (or eighty) screaming rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll fans who are waiting for you to do your magic trick. Waiting for you to pull something out of your hat, out of thin air, out of this world, something that before the faithful were gathered here today was just a song-fueled rumor.<br><br> I am here to provide proof of life to that ever elusive, never completely believable &#x201c;us.&#x201d; That is my magic trick. And like all good magic tricks, it begins with a setup. So...<br> &nbsp;<br> One<br> My Street<br> &nbsp;<br> I am ten years old and I know every crack, bone and crevice in the crumbling sidewalk running up and down Randolph Street, my street. Here, on passing afternoons I am Hannibal crossing the Alps, GIs locked in vicious mountain combat and countless cowboy heroes traversing the rocky trails of the Sierra Nevada. With my belly to the stone, alongside the tiny anthills that pop up volcanically where dirt and concrete meet, my world sprawls on into infinity, or at least to Peter McDermott&#x2019;s house on the corner of Lincoln and Randolph, one block up.<br><br> On these streets I have been rolled in my baby carriage, learned to walk, been taught by my grandfather to ride a bike, and fought and run from some of my first fights. I learned the depth and comfort of real friendships, felt my early sexual stirrings and, on the evenings before air-conditioning, watched the porches fill with neighbors seeking conversation and respite from the summer heat.<br><br> Here, in epic &#x201c;gutter ball&#x201d; tournaments, I slammed the first of a hundred Pinky rubber balls into my sidewalk&#x2019;s finely shaped curb. I climbed upon piles of dirty snow, swept high by midnight plows, walking corner to corner, the Edmund Hillary of New Jersey. My sister and I regularly stood like sideshow gawkers peering in through the huge wooden doors of our corner church, witnessing an eternal parade of baptisms, weddings and funerals. I followed my handsome, raggedly elegant grandfather as he tottered precariously around the block, left arm paralyzed against his chest, getting his &#x201c;exercise&#x201d; after a debilitating stroke he never came back from.<br><br> In our front yard, only feet from our porch, stands the grandest tree in town, a towering copper beech. Its province over our home is such that one bolt of well-placed lightning and we&#x2019;d all be dead as snails crushed beneath God&#x2019;s little finger. On &nbsp;nights when thunder &nbsp;rolls and lightning turns our family bedroom cobalt blue, I watch its arms move and come to life in the wind and white flashes as I lie awake worrying about my friend the monster outside. On sunny days, its roots are a fort for my soldiers, a corral for my horses and my second home. I hold the honor of being the first on our block to climb into its upper reaches. Here I find my escape from all below. I wander for hours amongst its branches, the sound of my buddies&#x2019; muted voices drifting up from the sidewalk below as they try to track my progress. Beneath its slumbering arms, on slow summer nights we sit, my pals and I, the cavalry at dusk, waiting for the evening bells of the ice-cream man and bed. I hear my grandmother&#x2019;s voice calling me in, the last sound of the long day. I step up onto our front porch, our windows glowing in the summer twilight; I let the heavy front door open and then close behind me, and for an hour or so in front of the kerosene stove, with my grandfather in his big chair, we watch the small black-and-white television screen light up the room, throwing its specters upon the walls and ceiling. Then, I drift to sleep tucked inside the greatest and saddest sanctuary I have ever known, my grandparents&#x2019; house.<br><br> I live here with my sister, Virginia, one year younger; my parents, Adele and Douglas Springsteen; my grandparents, Fred and Alice; and my dog Saddle. We live, literally, in the bosom of the Catholic Church, with the priest&#x2019;s rectory, the nuns&#x2019; convent, the St. Rose of Lima Church and gram- mar school all just a football&#x2019;s toss away across a field of wild grass.<br><br> Though he towers above us, here God is surrounded by man&#x2014;crazy men, to be exact. My family has five houses branching out in an L shape, anchored on the corner by the redbrick church. We are four houses of old- school Irish, the people who have raised me&#x2014;McNicholases, O&#x2019;Hagans, Farrells&#x2014;and across the street, one lonely outpost of Italians, who peppered my upbringing. These are the Sorrentinos and the Zerillis, hailing from Sorrento, Italy, via Brooklyn via Ellis Island. Here dwell my mother&#x2019;s mother, Adelina Rosa Zerilli; my mother&#x2019;s older sister, Dora; Dora&#x2019;s husband, Warren (an Irishman of course); and their daughter, my older cousin Margaret. Margaret and my cousin Frank are championship jitterbug dancers, winning contests and trophies up and down the Jersey Shore.<br><br> Though not unfriendly, the clans do not often cross the street to socialize with one another.<br><br> The house I live in with my grandparents is owned by my great- grandmother &#x201c;Nana&#x201d; McNicholas, my grandmother&#x2019;s mother, alive and kicking just up the street. I&#x2019;ve been told our town&#x2019;s first church service and first funeral were held in our living room. We live here beneath the lingering eyes of my father&#x2019;s older sister, my aunt Virginia, dead at five, killed by a truck while riding her tricycle past the corner gas station. Her portrait hovers, breathing a ghostly air into the room and shining her ill-fated destiny over our family gatherings.<br><br> Hers is a sepia-toned formal portrait of a little girl in an old-fashioned child&#x2019;s white linen dress. Her seemingly benign gaze, in the light of events, now communicates, &#x201c;Watch out! The world is a dangerous and unforgiving place that will knock your ass off your tricycle and into the dead black unknown and only these poor, misguided and unfortunate souls will miss you.&#x201d; Her mother, &nbsp;my grandma, heard that message loud and clear. She spent two years in bed after her daughter&#x2019;s death and sent my father, neglected, with rickets, off to the outskirts of town to live with other relatives while she recovered.<br><br> Time passed; my father quit school at sixteen, working as a floor boy in the Karagheusian Rug Mill, a clanging factory of looms and deafening machinery that stretched across both sides of Center Street in a part of town called &#x201c;Texas.&#x201d; At eighteen, he went to war, sailing on the <i>Queen Mary </i>out of New York City. He served as a truck driver at the Battle of the Bulge, saw what little of the world he was going to see and returned home. He played pool, very well, for money. He met and fell in love with my mother, promising that if she&#x2019;d marry him, he&#x2019;d get a real job (red flag!). He worked with his cousin, David &#x201c;Dim&#x201d; Cashion, on the line at the Ford Motor plant in Edison and I came along.<br><br> For my grandmother, I was the firstborn child of her only son and the first baby in the house since the death of her daughter. My birth re- turned to her a life of purpose. She seized on me with a vengeance. Her mission became my ultimate protection from the world within and with- out. Sadly, her blind single-minded devotion would lead to hard feelings with my father and enormous family confusion. It would drag all of us down.<br><br> When it rains, the moisture in the humid air blankets our town with the smell of damp coffee grounds wafting in from the Nescaf� factory at the town&#x2019;s eastern edge. I don&#x2019;t like coffee but I like that smell. It&#x2019;s com- forting; it unites the town in a common sensory experience; it&#x2019;s good industry, like the roaring rug mill that fills our ears, brings work and signals our town&#x2019;s vitality. There is a place here&#x2014;you can hear it, smell it&#x2014;where people make lives, suffer pain, enjoy small pleasures, play baseball, die, make love, have kids, drink &nbsp;themselves drunk &nbsp;on spring nights and do their best to hold off the demons that seek to destroy us, our homes, our families, our town.<br><br> Here &nbsp;we &nbsp;live in &nbsp;the &nbsp;shadow &nbsp;of the &nbsp;steeple, &nbsp;where &nbsp;the &nbsp;holy &nbsp;rubber meets the road, all crookedly blessed in God's &nbsp;mercy, in the heart-stopping, pants-dropping, race-riot-creating, oddball-hating, soul-shaking, love-and� fear-making, heartbreaking town of Freehold, New Jersey.<br> Let the service begin.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Two<br> My House<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s Thursday night, trash night. &nbsp;We are fully mobilized and ready to go. We have gathered in my grandfather&#x2019;s 1940s sedan waiting to be deployed to dig through every trash heap overflowing from the curbs of our town. First, we&#x2019;re heading to Brinckerhoff Avenue; that&#x2019;s where the money is and the trash is finest. We have come for your radios, any radios, no matter the condition. &nbsp;We will scavenge them from your junk pile, throw them into the trunk and bring them home to &#x201c;the shed,&#x201d; my grandfather&#x2019;s six-by-six-foot unheated wooden cubicle in a tiny corner of our house. Here, winter and summer, magic occurs. Here in a &#x201c;room&#x201d; filled with electrical wire and filament tubes, I will sit studiously at his side. While he wires, solders and exchanges bad tubes for good, we wait together for the same moment: that instant when the whispering breath, the beautiful low static hum and warm sundown &nbsp;glow of electricity will come surging back into the dead skeletons of radios we have pulled back from extinction.<br> &nbsp;<br> Here at my grandfather&#x2019;s workbench, the resurrection is real. The vacuum silence will be drawn up and filled with the distant, crackling voices of Sunday preachers, blabbering pitchmen, Big Band music, early rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll and serial dramas. It is the sound of the world outside straining to reach us, calling down into our little town and deeper, into our hermetically sealed universe here at 87 Randolph Street. Once returned to the living, all items will be sold for five dollars in the migrant camps that, come summer, &nbsp;will dot the farm fields on the edge of our borough. The &#x201c;radio man&#x201d; is coming. That&#x2019;s how my grandfather is known amongst the mostly Southern black migrant population that returns by bus every season to harvest the crops of rural Monmouth County. Down the dirt farm roads to the shacks in the rear where dust-bowl thirties conditions live on, my mother drives my stroke- addled grandpa to do his business amongst &#x201c;the blacks&#x201d; in their &#x201c;Mickey Mouse&#x201d; camps. I went once and was frightened out of my wits, surrounded in the dusk by hard-worn black faces. Race relations, never great in Free- hold, will explode ten years later into rioting and shootings, but for now, there is just a steady, uncomfortable &nbsp;quiet. I am simply the young prot�g� grandson of the &#x201c;radio man,&#x201d; here amongst his patrons where my family scrambles to make ends meet.<br><br> We were pretty near poor, though I never thought about it. We were clothed, fed and bedded. I had white and black friends worse off. My parents had jobs, my mother as a legal secretary and my father at Ford. Our house was old and soon to be noticeably decrepit. One kerosene stove in the living room was all we had to heat the whole place. Upstairs, where my family slept, you woke on winter mornings with your breath visible. One of my earliest childhood memories is the smell of kerosene and my grandfather standing there filling the spout in the rear of the stove. All of our cooking was done on a coal stove in the kitchen; as a child I&#x2019;d shoot my water gun at its hot iron surface and watch the steam rise. We&#x2019;d haul the ashes out the back door to the &#x201c;ash heap.&#x201d; Daily I&#x2019;d return from playing in that pile of dust pale from gray coal ash. We had a small box refrigerator and one of the first televisions in town. In an earlier life, before I was born, my granddad had been the proprietor of Springsteen Brothers Electrical Shop. So when TV hit, it arrived at our house first. My mother told me neighbors from up and down the block would stop by to see the new miracle, to watch Milton Berle, Kate Smith and <i>Your Hit Parade</i>. To see wrestlers like Bruno Sammartino face off against Haystacks Calhoun. By the time I was six I knew every word to the Kate Smith anthem, &#x201c;When the Moon Comes Over the Mountain.&#x201d;<br><br> In this house, due to order of birth and circumstance, I was lord, king and the messiah all rolled into one. Because I was the first grandchild, my grandmother &nbsp;latched on to me to replace my dead aunt Virginia. Nothing was out of bounds. It was a terrible freedom for a young boy and I embraced it with everything I had. I stayed up until three a.m. and slept until three p.m. at five and six years old. I watched TV until it went off and I was left staring alone at the test pattern. I ate what and when I wanted. My parents and I became distant relatives and my mother, in her confusion and desire to keep the peace, ceded me to my grandmother&#x2019;s total dominion. A timid little tyrant, I soon felt like the rules were for the rest of the world, at least until my dad came home. He would lord sullenly over the kitchen, a monarch dethroned by his own firstborn son at his mother&#x2019;s insistence. Our ruin of a house and my own eccentricities and power at such a young age shamed and embarrassed me. I could see the rest of the world was running on a different clock and I was teased for my habits pretty thoroughly by my neighborhood pals. I loved my entitlement, but I knew it wasn&#x2019;t right.<br><br> When I became of school age and had to conform to a time schedule, it sent me into an inner rage that lasted most of my school years. My mother knew we were all way overdue for a reckoning and, to her credit, tried to reclaim me. She moved us out of my grandmother&#x2019;s house to a small, half- shotgun-style house at 39� Institute Street. No hot water, four tiny rooms, four blocks away from my grandparents. There she tried to set some normal boundaries. It was too late. Those four blocks might as well have been a million miles. I was roaring with anger and loss and every chance I got, I returned to stay with my grandparents. It was my true home and they felt like my real parents.

This groundbreaking work by Denmark's leading science writer draws on psychology, evolutionary biology, information theory, and other disciplines to argue its revolutionary point: that consciousness represents only an infinitesimal fraction of our ability to process information. Although we are unaware of it, our brains sift through and discard billions of pieces of data in order to allow us to understand the world around us. In fact, most of what we call thought is actually the unconscious discarding of information. What our consciousness rejects constitutes the most valuable part of ourselves, the "Me" that the "I" draws on for most of our actions--fluent speech, riding a bicycle, anything involving expertise. No wonder that, in this age of information, so many of us feel empty and dissatisfied. As engaging as it is insightful, this important book encourages us to rely more on what our instincts and our senses tell us so that we can better appreciate the richness of human life.</p><p>The "user illusion" in computing is the desktop graphical user interface (GUI): the friendly, comprehensible illusion presented to the user to conceal all the bouncing bits and bytes that do the actual work. Tor N�rretranders writes that "our consciousness is a user illusion for ourselves and the world ... one's very own map of oneself and one's possibilities of intervening in the world." Much of N�rretranders' evidence comes from comparing the wide bandwidth of experience to the narrow bandwidth of consciousness, and from examining how much of our brain function is never consciously acknowledged. Although slightly out of date (the book was written in 1991; it was a bestseller in Europe), <i>The User Illusion</i> has been well translated and gives a refreshing, non-Anglophone take on a problem that is not likely to go away anytime soon.<b>Tor N�rretranders&nbsp;</b>is a Danish writer, speaker, thinker, and self-identified &#x201c;science storyteller&#x201d; who writes with &#x201c;a sophistication rarely seen in popular science writing&#x201d; (<i>New York Times</i>).

Every tabloid and woman&#x2019;s magazine screams a similar message at you. In an attempt to silence them, you look away and study the vegetables in your basket. All you wanted was a piece of gum, but you got more to chew on than you had bargained for! As you contemplate your broccoli, you pray, <i>God, I know sex orgies are wrong, but what about a wife seducing her husband? Where do I draw the line on sexual acts? What is right? What is wrong? Can I be both godly and sensuous? I wish I knew how I should think about sex and how You, God, think about sex.<br><br></i>If you feel confused when it comes to sex, you are not alone. Most women have not grasped God&#x2019;s view of sex. They are unsure what He thinks because His voice is often lost in the discordant symphony of voices clamoring to be heard. With so many mixed messages, it&#x2019;s no wonder many are confused.<br><br>CONFLICTING VOICES CAN CAUSE CONFUSION<br>If we listened to the <i>Victorian voices, </i>we&#x2019;d be confused.<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk about <i>it; </i>stay under the covers with the lights off.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Do <i>it </i>only in the missionary position.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;<i>It </i>is only for men.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Chin up, honey. Just endure <i>it.</i>&#x201d;<br><br>If we listened to the <i>voices of sexual pioneers, </i>we&#x2019;d be confused. Psychologists Sigmund Freud, Henry Havelock Ellis, Alfred Kinsey, William Masters, and Virginia Johnson called for women to come out from under their &#x201c;Victorian covers&#x201d; and be sexual creatures. While their words contained<br>positive components, their tone often offended our sensibilities.<br><br>Here is how your body works.

It&#x2019;s every woman&#x2019;s right, make<br>your &#x201c;personal computer&#x201d; do its thing.<br><br>If we listened to the <i>voices of certain church fathers, </i>we&#x2019;d be confused. Augustine allowed that sex is good but passion and desire are sin. &#x201c;For he who is intemperate in marriage, what is he but the adulterer of his own wife.&#x201d; Thomas Aquinas thought as long as sex was not enjoyed,2 marriage was acceptable for those unable to accept the requirements of monastic existence. Martin Luther had these words to say: &#x201c;Intercourse is never without sin; but God excuses it by his grace because the estate of marriage is his work.&#x201d;3 Sex without passion or enjoyment? Intercourse a sin? With such a heritage no wonder Christian women are confused.<br><br>If we listened to the <i>voices of mothers, </i>we&#x2019;d be confused. Of course, some mothers gave wise advice, but others sent negative messages:<br>&#x201c;Only &#x2018;those kinds&#x2019; of girls enjoy sex.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sex is a man&#x2019;s thing. You just endure it.&#x201d;<br><br>And the least helpful response: S I L E N C E.<br>If we listened to the <i>voices of some older married women, </i>we&#x2019;d be confused.<br>Many equated sex with duty and often complained:<br>&#x201c;Wait until you&#x2019;ve been married twenty years, it gets old.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;After two years of marriage, the excitement vanishes. You&#x2019;ll see.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Give him his sex so you can have your children.&#x201d;<br><br>If we listened to the <i>voice of the media, </i>we&#x2019;d really be confused.<br>Sex always just happens naturally.<br>The woman is always instantly passionate, instantly ready. She never needs love, encouragement, or foreplay. Her sexual glands activate atthe unbuttoning of a shirt.<br>Both the man and the woman know everything, do everything just right, and are instant perfect lovers.<br>Tiredness vanishes with one passionate look.<br>Neither the man nor the woman ever has morning breath. The woman wakes up, makeup in place, the man&#x2019;s hair neatly combed.<br><br>Does any of this sound familiar? All of these voices have influenced the way we view our sexuality. God&#x2019;s thoughts about His gift of sex have been so distorted that many women don&#x2019;t know what to believe. Some wonder if something is wrong with them.<br><br>&#x201c;In movies making love looks so simple. Couples fall into bed in fits of passion. They catch their breath, and then go at it again. I feel like something is wrong with me. I need foreplay, time to be aroused sexually. I can&#x2019;t see myself spending two days in bed. I guess I&#x2019;m just not very sensuous.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sometimes when we make love, I have something on my mind about the children, our home, the gardening, and it&#x2019;s hard for me to get into lovemaking. What&#x2019;s wrong with me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I grew up confused about sex. It was obvious my parents avoided one another. Now that I&#x2019;m married, the magazines at the newsstand say there is something wrong with me if I don&#x2019;t have this compulsion to<br>dress up like Jane and swing around the room with my Tarzan. Whom do I listen to? No matter what I do, it&#x2019;s wrong.&#x201d;<br><br>There <i>is </i>something wrong, but not with these wives. What&#x2019;s wrong are the voices. On the one hand they whisper that sex is evil, and on the other hand they yell, &#x201c;Do it!&#x201d; Anytime, anywhere with anyone. Multiple positions, multiple orgasms, multiple multiples!<br><br>This is not what God intended. It&#x2019;s time to silence the voices who cry in the darkness and listen instead to the One Voice who whispers the truth in the light. Do you hear Him? God is calling you, pleading with you to hear His voice. He who made us has much to say about sex&#x2014;He invented the idea. Let&#x2019;s open our ears. Open our eyes. Open our hearts.<br><br>God&#x2019;s voice&#x2014;His Word&#x2014;tells us why He created sex.<br>GOD&#x2019;S VOICE DECLARES:<br><br>&#x201c;I GAVE THE GIFT OF SEX THAT YOU MIGHT CREATE LIFE&#x201d;<br><br>God formed Adam from the dust of the earth. Then He fashioned Eve from Adam&#x2019;s rib. He could have continued creating man and woman in this way or chosen from a multitude of other options available to Him. But in His perfect wisdom, God designed sexual intercourse as the best plan for man and woman to create a new life. Beginning in Genesis, we are commanded<br>to &#x201c;be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth&#x201d; (1:28). This may be the only commandment given by God that His people have consistently applied. The gift of sex gives us the unspeakable privilege of creating a child from our love. How incredibly creative our God is!<br><br>Some have wondered if God instructed Adam and Eve: &#x201c;This is what you do to make a baby . . .&#x201d; We don&#x2019;t think so. God exquisitely crafted the<i> </i>man and woman&#x2019;s bodies so that they would mold and fit together. Can you imagine Adam and Eve&#x2019;s amazement and wonder when they discovered this? And their glorious ecstasy when they held their baby in their arms, a creation of their love?<br><br>GOD&#x2019;S VOICE DECLARES:<br>&#x201c;I GAVE THE GIFT OF SEX FOR INTIMATE ONENESS&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave to his wife; and they shall become one flesh&#x201d; (Genesis 2:24). Isn&#x2019;t this an incredible thought? Two separate beings become so bonded, so connected, so woven together in body, soul, and spirit that God sees them as one being rather than two.<br><br>The apostle Paul quotes this verse and expounds upon its meaning. He describes the one flesh between husband and wife as a great mystery. A mystery is usually something secret or hidden, but Paul makes the mysterious plain. God&#x2019;s Word says our sexual oneness is an earthly picture of the spiritual oneness Christ is to have with His church (Ephesians 5:31-32).<br><br>In light of this, how can anyone say God thought sex was wrong or dirty when He, the almighty Creator of the universe, said our physical oneness is to be a picture of the spiritual oneness He wants to have with us? It&#x2019;s as if God is saying, &#x201c;Through your lovemaking, I&#x2019;ve given you a visual picture so that when you experience the beauty of physical intimacy, you will have a glimmer, an earthly idea, of all I desire for you spiritually, a sweet union of your spirit with mine.&#x201d; Such glorious oneness is almost beyond comprehension.<br><br>GOD&#x2019;S VOICE DECLARES:<br><br>&#x201c;I GAVE THE GIFT OF SEX FOR KNOWLEDGE&#x201d;<br><br>In Genesis 4:1 (NKJV) we read, &#x201c;Now Adam knew [had sexual intercourse with] Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain.&#x201d; The Hebrew word for &#x201c;sexual intercourse&#x201d; is the word &#x201c;to know.&#x201d; Through God&#x2019;s gift of sex, a husband and wife receive an intimate knowing of one<br>another that they have with no one else. This knowledge brings a depth to their relationship. Mike Mason says it beautifully in <i>The Mystery of Marriage.<br><br></i>For in touching a person of the opposite sex in the most secret place of his or her body, with one&#x2019;s own most private part, there is something that reaches beyond touch, that gets behind flesh itself to the<br>place where it connects with spirit, to the place where incarnation happens.4<br><br>GOD&#x2019;S VOICE DECLARES:<br><br>&#x201c;I GAVE THE GIFT OF SEX FOR PLEASURE&#x201d;<br><br>Would you believe Scripture talks more about the pleasures of sex than it does about &#x201c;being fruitful&#x201d; and &#x201c;being one&#x201d;? God devoted an entire book of the Bible, the Song of Solomon, to the subject of sexual pleasure in marriage. Many other passages also speak of the joys of married love. Listen toGod&#x2019;s voice:<br><br>Drink from your own well, my son&#x2014;be faithful and true to your wife.<br>. . . Let your manhood be a blessing; rejoice in the wife of your youth.<br>Let her charms and tender embrace satisfy you. Let her love alone fill<br>you with delight. (Proverbs 5:15,18-19, TLB)<br><br>The first part of this verse draws a beautiful parallel between thirst being quenched by drinks of cool, fresh water and a couple&#x2019;s sexual thirst being satisfied by exciting, pleasurable lovemaking. The second part of the verse describes the emotion a couple experiences when they embrace. Our favorite paraphrase of this passage reads:<br><br>Let your love and your sexual embrace with your wife intoxicate you<br>continually with delight. Always enjoy the ecstasy of her love.<br><br>It would be difficult to find stronger words than <i>intoxicate </i>and <i>ecstasy</i>. These are God&#x2019;s words, this is His voice saying to you, &#x201c;Enjoy your husband, give to him, receive from him. Delight yourself in the erotic feelings of sexual love.&#x201d;<br><i><br></i>GOD&#x2019;S VOICE DECLARES:<br><br>&#x201c;I GAVE THE GIFT OF SEX AS A DEFENSE AGAINST TEMPTATION&#x201d;<br><br>God&#x2019;s gift of sexuality can be used as a powerful force for good or for evil. To make certain His gift was used for good&#x2014;to create a child, to give unique knowledge, intimate oneness, pleasure, and comfort&#x2014;God wrapped His gift within the bonds of the marriage vows. Proverbs warns<br>young men about the temptations of sexual lust and encourages them to &#x201c;Drink water from your own cistern, and fresh water from your own well&#x201d; (5:15). The following passage makes it clear that sex in marriage is a deterrent to temptation:<br><br>But because of immoralities, let each man have his own wife, and let<br>each woman have her own husband. . . . Stop depriving one another,<br>except by agreement for a time that you may devote yourselves to<br>prayer, and come together again lest Satan tempt you because of your<br>lack of self-control. (1 Corinthians 7:2,5)<br><br>GOD&#x2019;S VOICE DECLARES:<br><br>&#x201c;I GAVE THE GIFT OF SEX FOR COMFORT&#x201d;<br><br>Part of God&#x2019;s plan for sex is to impart comfort. Listen to this account in 2 Samuel where David and Bathsheba&#x2019;s son has died. While grieving &#x201c;David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her and lay with her. So she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon&#x201d; (12:24, NKJV). Such<br>lovemaking is rich with compassion and love . . . no wonder it brings solace!<br><br>Janette told us that when her husband was in despair over losing his job, the most effective comfort and encouragement she gave him was to love him physically. Shelly, married to an intense man, said that when her husband had spent his day at the office slaying dragons with little success, she knew she could comfort him and help him relax by making love to him. Ginny shared this touching account with us:<br><br>My husband was heaped in a chair, deeply discouraged. A friend had betrayed him. &#x201c;Honey, take off your shirt and lie on the bed. I&#x2019;ve got hot oil and am going to massage the tension out of your muscles.&#x201d;<br>As I rubbed his shoulders and back, I could feel his tension evaporate. I took off his remaining clothes and massaged the rest of his body. Then I comforted him with my love. It wasn&#x2019;t a sensuous time<br>of lovemaking or a glorious time of intimate oneness. It was a time of giving comfort. When he sighed deeply and fell asleep, I felt such joy because of the love I had been able to give.<br><br>Lovemaking comforts because it releases tension. A backrub is good for tense bodies, a sexual release even better. God was ingenious in His creation. Through our lovemaking we can create life, experience one-flesh intimacy and deep knowledge, enjoy deep pleasure, and even comfort each other in times of stress or sorrow.<br><br>LISTEN TO GOD&#x2019;S VOICE<br><br>The world has desecrated God&#x2019;s beautiful gift of sex. What He made pure, the world putrefied. What He made sacred, the world made sleazy. What the world did was wrong, but a wife is just as wrong if she allows the world&#x2019;s desecration to keep her from embracing the beauty of God&#x2019;s viewpoint. God desires that a husband and wife be naked and unashamed, glorying in the giving and receiving of exquisite pleasure and rejoicing in the intimate oneness that sex brings.<br><br>Wherever you are today, be assured that God is a God who redeems. He longs to show you that His gift can be erotic, fulfilling, free, and beautiful. But in order for you to enjoy the sexual relationship within your marriage, you have to throw out the mental tapes which play any message that conflicts with God&#x2019;s voice. You need to hear His voice alone; you need to listen to the One Voice. Our gracious God will speak to you. He longs to help you. And if you ask, He will redeem His beautiful gift in your life and make all things new.<br><i>God, I choose to close my ears to the voices of the world and listen to You. I trust You to heal where healing is needed, to teach me where I lack wisdom, and to direct me as I seek to enjoy intimacy with my husband. I surrender myself to You and ask You to redeem Your beautiful gift of sex in my life.<br></i></p><h2>Swahili-English/English-Swahili Practical Dictionary (Hippocrene Practical Dictionary)</h2><p><p><b>This bestselling bilingual Swahili dictionary is the also most comprehensive available, with over 35,000 entries that cover the modern vocabulary of politics, telecommunications, the Internet, tourism, business and travel.</b></p> <p>Swahili is the most widely spoken African language and the lingua franca of Eastern Africa, including Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, and eastern Congo (Zaire).

Sadly, many students have fallen asleep over these same exercises. Ordinary daily proofreading exercises try to do too much&#x2015;i.e., force-feed facts and information as they also try to teach writing. A Sentence a Day takes a different approach. It focuses on short, playful, interesting sentences with a sense of humor. Students receive proofreading practice in daily doses that don't overwhelm. Each exercise should take only a few minutes of class time, allowing for frequent, consistent reinforcement and practice of serious writing skills. Each page of the book shows the incorrect sentence, a sample correction, and notes for the teacher. You may write the incorrect sentence on the board, or make a transparency of the page and show it on an overhead, covering up the answers.</p><p>Samantha Prust is a freelance writer who has contributed materials for many language arts textbooks.

Echoes of her name bounced off the shadowy walls of the Announ cer, sending licks of heat rippling across her skin. Was that Daniel&#x2019;s voice or Cam&#x2019;s? Arriane&#x2019;s or Gabbe&#x2019;s? Was it Roland pleading that she come back now, or was that Miles? <br><br> The calls grew harder to discern, until Luce couldn&#x2019;t tell them apart at all: good or evil. Enemy or friend. They should have been easier to separate, but nothing was easy anymore. Everything that had once been black and white now blended into gray. <br><br>Of course, both sides agreed on one thing: Everyone wanted to pull her out of the Announcer. For her <i>protec�tion, </i>they would claim. <br><br>No, thanks. <br><br>Not now. <br><br>Not after they&#x2019;d wrecked her parents&#x2019; backyard, made it into another one of their dusty battlefields. She couldn&#x2019;t think about her parents&#x2019; faces without wanting to turn back&#x2014;not like she&#x2019;d even know how to turn back inside an Announcer, anyway. Besides, it was too late. Cam had tried to <i>kill </i>her. Or what he thought was her. And Miles had saved her, but even that wasn&#x2019;t sim�ple. He&#x2019;d only been able to throw her reflection because he cared about her <i>too </i>much. <br><br>And Daniel? Did he care enough? She couldn&#x2019;t tell. <br><br>In the end, when the Outcast had approached her, Daniel and the others had stared at Luce like <i>she </i>was the one who owed <i>them </i>something. <br> <i><br>You are our entrance into Heaven, </i>the Outcast had told her. <i>The price. </i>What had that meant? Until a couple of weeks ago she hadn&#x2019;t even known the Outcasts existed. And yet, they wanted something from her&#x2014;badly enough to battle Daniel for it. It must have had to do with the curse, the one that kept Luce reincarnated lifetime after lifetime. But what did they think Luce could do? <br><br> Was the answer buried somewhere here? <br><br>Her stomach lurched as she tumbled senselessly through the cold shadow, deep inside the chasm of the dark Announcer. <br> <i><br>Luce&#x2014; </i><br><br>The voices began to fade and grow dimmer. Soon they were barely whispers. Almost like they had given up. Until&#x2014; <br><br>They started to grow louder again. Louder and clearer. <br> <i><br>Luce&#x2014; </i><br> <i><br>No. </i>She clamped her eyes shut to try to block them out. <br> <i><br>Lucinda&#x2014; </i><br> <i><br>Lucy&#x2014; </i><br> <i><br>Lucia&#x2014; </i><br> <i><br>Luschka&#x2014; </i><br><br>She was cold and she was tired and she didn&#x2019;t want to hear them. For once, she wanted to be left alone. <br> <i><br>Luschka! Luschka! Luschka! </i><br><br>Her feet hit something with a <i>thwump. </i><br><br>Something very, very cold. <br><br>She was standing on solid ground. She knew she wasn&#x2019;t tumbling anymore, though she couldn&#x2019;t see anything in front of her except for the blanket of blackness. Then she looked down at her Converse sneakers. <br><br>And gulped. <br><br>They were planted in a blanket of snow that reached midway up her calves. The dank coolness that she was used to&#x2014;the shadowy tunnel she&#x2019;d been traveling through, out of her backyard, into the past&#x2014;was giving way to something else. Something blustery and ab�solutely frigid. <br><br>The first time Luce had stepped through an Announcer&#x2014;from her Shoreline dorm room to Las Vegas&#x2014;she&#x2019;d been with her friends Shelby and Miles. At the end of the passage they&#x2019;d met a barrier: a dark, shad�owy curtain between them and the city. Because Miles was the only one who&#x2019;d read the texts on stepping through, he&#x2019;d started swiping the Announcer with a cir�cular motion until the murky black shadow flaked away. Luce hadn&#x2019;t known until now that he&#x2019;d been troubleshooting. <br><br>This time, there was no barrier. Maybe because she was traveling alone, through an Announcer summoned of her own fierce will. But the way out was so easy. Al�most too easy. The veil of blackness simply parted. <br><br>A blast of cold tore into her, making her knees lock with the chill. Her ribs stiffened and <br><br>her eyes teared in the sharp, sudden wind. <br><br>Where was she? <br><br> Luce already regretted her panicked jump through time. Yes, she needed an escape, and yes, she wanted to trace her past, to save her former selves from all the pain, to understand what kind of love she&#x2019;d had with Daniel all those other times. To <i>feel </i>it instead of being told about it. To understand&#x2014;and then fix&#x2014;whatever curse had been inflicted on Daniel and her. <br><br>But not like this. Frozen, alone, and completely un�prepared for wherever, whenever she was. <br><br>She could see a snowy street in front of her, a steel-gray sky above white buildings. She could hear some�thing rumbling in the distance. But she didn&#x2019;t want to think about what any of it meant. <br><br>&#x201c;Wait,&#x201d; she whispered to the Announcer. <br><br>The shadow drifted hazily a foot or so beyond her fingertips. She tried to grasp it, but the Announcer eluded her, flicking farther away. She leaped for it, and caught a tiny damp piece of it between her fingers&#x2014; <br><br>But then, in an instant, the Announcer shattered into soft black fragments on the snow. <br>They faded, then were gone. <br><br>&#x201c;Great,&#x201d; she muttered. &#x201c;Now what?&#x201d; <br><br>In the distance, the narrow road curved left to meet a shadowy intersection. The sidewalks were piled high with shoveled snow, which had been packed against two long banks of white stone buildings. They were striking, unlike anything Luce had ever seen, a few stories tall, with their entire fa�ades carved into rows of bright white arches and elaborate columns. <br><br> All the windows were dark. Luce got the sense that the whole city might be dark. The only light came from a single gas streetlamp. If there was any moon, it was hidden by a thick blanket of cloud. Again something rumbled in the sky. Thunder? <br><br>Luce hugged her arms around her chest. She was freezing. <br><br>&#x201c;Luschka!&#x201d; <br><br>A woman&#x2019;s voice. Hoarse and raspy, like someone who&#x2019;d spent her whole life barking orders. But the voice was trembling, too. <br><br>&#x201c;Luschka, you idiot. Where are you?&#x201d; <br><br>She sounded closer now. Was she talking to Luce? There was something else about that voice, something strange that Luce couldn&#x2019;t quite put into words. <br><br>When a figure came hobbling around the snowy street corner, Luce stared at the <br>woman, trying to place her. She was very short and a little hunched over, maybe in her late sixties. Her bulky clothes seemed too big for her body. Her hair was tucked under a thick black scarf. When she saw Luce, her face scrunched into a compli�cated grimace. <br><br>&#x201c;Where have you been?&#x201d; <br><br>Luce looked around. She was the only other person on the street. The old woman was speaking to her. <br><br> &#x201c;Right here,&#x201d; she heard herself say. <br><br><i>In Russian. </i><br><br>She clapped a hand over her mouth. So <i>that </i>was what had seemed so bizarre about the old woman&#x2019;s voice: She was speaking a language Luce had never learned. And yet, not only did Luce understand every word, but she could speak it back. <br><br>&#x201c;I could kill you,&#x201d; the woman said, breathing heavily as she rushed toward Luce and threw her arms around her. <br><br>For such a frail-looking woman, her embrace was strong. The warmth of another body pressing into Luce after so much intense cold made her almost want to cry. She hugged back hard. <br><br>&#x201c;Grandma?&#x201d; she whispered, her lips close to the woman&#x2019;s ear, somehow knowing that was who the woman was. <br><br>&#x201c;Of all the nights I get off work to find you gone,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;Now you&#x2019;re skipping around in the middle of the street like a lunatic? Did you even go to work today? Where is your sister?&#x201d; <br><br>There was the rumbling in the sky again. It sounded like a bad storm moving closer. Moving fast. Luce shiv�ered and shook her head. She didn&#x2019;t know. <br><br>&#x201c;Aha,&#x201d; the woman said. &#x201c;Not so carefree now.&#x201d; She squinted at Luce, then pushed her away to get a closer look. &#x201c;My God, what are you wearing?&#x201d; <br><br> Luce fidgeted as her past life&#x2019;s grandmother gaped at her jeans and ran her knobby fingers over the buttons of Luce&#x2019;s flannel shirt. She grabbed Luce&#x2019;s short, tangled ponytail. &#x201c;Sometimes I think you are as crazy as your fa�ther, may he rest in peace.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I just&#x2014;&#x201d; Luce&#x2019;s teeth were chattering. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t know it was going to be so cold.&#x201d; <br><br>The woman spat on the snow to show her disap�proval. She peeled off her overcoat. &#x201c;Take this before you catch your death.&#x201d; She bundled the coat roughly around Luce, whose fingers were half frozen as she struggled to button it. Then her grandmother untied the scarf from her neck and wrapped it around Luce&#x2019;s head. <br><br>A great boom in the sky startled both of them. Now Luce knew it wasn&#x2019;t thunder. &#x201c;What is that?&#x201d; she whis�pered. <br><br>The old woman stared at her. &#x201c;The war,&#x201d; she mut�tered. &#x201c;Did you lose your wits along with your clothes? Come now. We must go.&#x201d; <br><br>As they waded down the snowy street, over the rough cobbles and the tram tracks set into them, Luce realized that the city wasn&#x2019;t empty after all. Few cars were parked along the road, but occasionally, down the darkened side streets, she heard the whinnies of carriage horses waiting for orders, their frosty breaths clotting the air. Silhouetted bodies scampered across rooftops. Down an alley, a man in a torn overcoat helped three small children through the hatched doors of a basement. <br><br> At the end of the narrow street, the road opened onto a broad, tree-lined avenue with a wide view of the city. The only cars parked here were military vehicles. They looked old-fashioned, almost absurd, like relics in a war museum: soft-top jeeps with giant fenders, bone-thin steering wheels, and the Soviet hammer and sickle painted onto the doors. But aside from Luce and her grandmother, there were no people on this street. Everything&#x2014;except for the awful rumbling in the sky&#x2014;was ghostly, eerily quiet. <br><br>In the distance, she could see a river, and far across it, a great building. Even in the darkness, she could make out its elaborate tiered spires and ornate onion-shaped domes, which seemed familiar and mythic at the same time. It took a moment to sink in&#x2014;and then fear shot through Luce. <br><br>She was in Moscow.</p><h2>Perfect Blue: Complete Metamorphosis (Light Novel) (Perfect Blue (Light Novel))</h2><p><p><b>THE ORIGINAL NOVEL THAT INSPIRED THE CULT CLASSIC FILM BY SATOSHI KON</b></p><p>Kirigoe Mima is in the third year of her career as a pure and innocent pop idol.

One rainy night, the wizard Merlin tells Arthur the story of dueling dragons and a fateful clash between good and evil, which reveals the surprising secret of the boy king's true legacy. Li Ming's arresting oil paintings breathe fire into this magical offering from Jane Yolen."The legend comes alive on a grand scale, the dramatic narrative and well-wrought dialogue heightening the theatrical effect and inviting a fast-paced read-aloud." -- <i>School Library Journal</i></p><p>Born and raised in New York City, <b>Jane Yolen</b> now lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts. She attended Smith College and received her master's degree in education from the University of Massachusetts. The distinguished author of more than 170 books, Jane Yolen is a person of many talents. When she is not writing, Yolen composes songs, is a professional storyteller on the stage, and is the busy wife of a university professor, the mother of three grown children, and a grandmother. All of Yolen's stories and poems are rooted in her sense of family and self.&nbsp;<i>The Emperor and the Kite</i>, which was a Caldecott Honor Book in 1983 for its intricate paper-cut illustrations by Ed Young, was based on Yolen's relationship with her late father, who was an international kite-flying champion.&nbsp;<i>Owl Moon</i>, winner of the 1988 Caldecott Medal for John Schoenherr's exquisite watercolors, was inspired by her husband's interest in birding.<br><br><b>Li Ming </b>is an illustrator whose works include <i>Merlin and the Dragons.&nbsp;</i>Grade 3-5?Drawing once again upon Arthurian legend, Yolen has created a stirring tale within a tale. Young Arthur wakes one stormy night from uneasy dreams and seeks out the company of Merlin. Sensing the boy's readiness to learn of his legacy in claiming the crown he wears without conviction, Merlin tells him of another fatherless boy, Emrys, who dreamed baffling dreams of dragons and crumbling stone towers. When the cruel Vortigern attempted to take over all of Britain, Emrys's dreams became prophetic and catalytic. Merlin ends his tale cryptically, as a certain knight advances toward Vortigern's tower. When Arthur cries out for a proper ending, Merlin draws him into the story and it becomes revelatory?at last he is able to call the crown his own. Yolen goes beyond her sources?folklore and history?and moves expertly into the realm of invention. Matched with arresting oil paintings, the legend comes alive on a grand scale, the dramatic narrative and well-wrought dialogue heightening the theatrical effect and inviting a fast-paced read-aloud. Some of Ming's illustrations are magnificent, those of the dragons in particular. One can sense this talented artist's respect for these creatures as he brings them fully to life?terrifying, violent, beautiful. So, too, does he paint Arthur with great sensitivity, a figure bathed in light, his face complex, thoughtful, and full of wonder. Although all the pictures serve the story well and elevate the drama, some seem a bit flat and overexplicit, without the pulsing life and radiance that characterizes those that are invested with emotion and are remarkable for their power.<br><i>Susan Powers, Rock Creek Forest Elementary School, Chevy Chase, MD</i><br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Crystal Keepers (3) (Five Kingdoms)</h2><p>Trapped in a world where magic is powerful and dreams are real, Cole continues his quest in book three of this <i>New York Times </i>bestselling &#x201c;fanciful, action-packed adventure&#x201d; series (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review), from the author of the Fablehaven and Beyonders series.<br><br>Cole Randolph still can&#x2019;t believe the way his life has been turned inside out.

He tossed it over Ranger&#x2019;s back, but the quilted pad fell through the horse to the ground.<br> <br>Cole whirled. &#x201c;Dalton?&#x201d;<br> <br>His friend stood a short distance away, arms folded, leaning against a tree trunk. &#x201c;Not bad?&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole picked up the saddle pad and shook off the dirt. &#x201c;Really good, actually.&#x201d; He swiped a hand through the horse, feeling only a vague, cobwebby sensation. &#x201c;That looks perfect.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I moved Ranger last night after you conked out,&#x201d; Dalton confessed. The illusionary horse disappeared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Couldn&#x2019;t sleep again?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;I tried,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t shut down my brain. It took some time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dalton!&#x201d; another voice called. Taller than Cole and Dalton by a few inches, though not much older, Jace stormed over to them, his deeply tanned face flushed. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my saddle?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton cracked a smile. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it over there?&#x201d; he asked, pointing.<br> <br>Cole followed his finger to where Jace&#x2019;s saddle leaned against a mossy log.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ha-ha,&#x201d; Jace said. &#x201c;I already tried to grab it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The saddle vanished.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s two really good seemings at once,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;How long did you maintain them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Since right before you two got up,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;Fifteen minutes or something.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace huffed. &#x201c;Good for you. Maybe you and Skye can set up your own dazzle show. Now where&#x2019;s my saddle?&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton looked around innocently, then craned his head back. Cole tracked his gaze up into a tree where a saddle straddled a high branch, and a laugh spurted out before he could hold it back.<br> <br>&#x201c;That better not be real,&#x201d; Jace threatened. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll drop it on your head.&#x201d;<br> <br>The saddle disappeared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Three seemings at the same time?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s over by that stump,&#x201d; Dalton said, nodding toward the one he meant.<br> <br>As Cole watched, the scarred old stump melted away to reveal Jace&#x2019;s saddle. &#x201c;Four,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;And they all looked great.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton shrugged.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice waste of time, Dalton,&#x201d; Jace complained. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re on the run.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d do the same thing if you could work seemings,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d make you two walk off a cliff,&#x201d; Jace said.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d kill us?&#x201d; Dalton exclaimed.<br> <br>&#x201c;Into a lake,&#x201d; Jace said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d get two of the highest screams ever.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d cannonball in and make two of the biggest splashes ever,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;Then we&#x2019;d come for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be pretty scared,&#x201d; Jace said with a snort. &#x201c;You guys better hurry up and get ready. We&#x2019;re moving out.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole turned to reach for his saddle, but Dalton restrained him. &#x201c;Wait for it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace hoisted his saddle pad and saddle together, marched over to his horse, and flung them onto its back. The saddle fell through the illusion to the dirt. Jace turned and glared.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pick up the pace!&#x201d; Dalton called. &#x201c;The horses are this way. We&#x2019;re heading out!&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton grabbed Cole&#x2019;s saddle pad and Cole claimed his saddle. They walked together toward where Dalton had moved the horses. Cole glanced at his friend. They had come to the Outskirts together from Mesa, Arizona. When they arrived, they knew nothing about this world. They&#x2019;d never heard of shaping or the High King or even knew that a place like the Outskirts was possible. A slave trader had kidnapped dozens of kids visiting a neighborhood haunted house on Halloween and brought them to a bizarre new world. Shortly after their arrival they were marked as slaves and scattered across the five kingdoms. They started out alone&#x2014;strangers in a strange land.<br> <br>But they were gradually figuring things out. Cole had managed to find his best friend, and Dalton had some crazy strong abilities.<br> <br>&#x201c;That was amazing,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;But why go after Jace so hard? He&#x2019;s a hothead. You&#x2019;re going to get punched in the face if you don&#x2019;t watch out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He hid my saddle yesterday,&#x201d; Dalton replied. &#x201c;If he wants to make jokes, he has to take them too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t hide your saddle,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to make him the only target,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;I know you can take a joke.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. Because we&#x2019;re friends and we get each other. Jace could be a different story. I&#x2019;m not sure you want to tangle with him.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t let him think he&#x2019;s Mr. Big Shot. So if Jace teases&#x2014;we tease him back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I get standing up to him,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;But is it smart to prank him?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the worst he could do?&#x201d; Dalton asked. &#x201c;I mean really. Retaliate somehow? If he does, I&#x2019;ll get him again. It&#x2019;ll save us trouble down the road.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about when we leave Elloweer?&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;You won&#x2019;t be able to make illusions in Zeropolis.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton sighed regretfully. &#x201c;That&#x2019;ll stink. But all the more reason to get him while I can. If he respects me, he&#x2019;ll back off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Or he&#x2019;ll tease you harder until you cave,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>Dalton shrugged. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t give up.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s risky,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more risky to let him bug me whenever he wants,&#x201d; Dalton replied. &#x201c;Wait and see.&#x201d;<br> <br>They reached Cole&#x2019;s horse.<br> <br>&#x201c;You first,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>Dalton laid the saddle pad across the animal&#x2019;s back. &#x201c;This one&#x2019;s real.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole swung the saddle onto the pad. &#x201c;You better mount up too.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If Jace is my biggest problem before we leave Elloweer, I&#x2019;ll be grateful,&#x201d; Dalton said, walking away.<br> <br>Cole gave a nod. &#x201c;I can agree with that one.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Shortly after sunrise the Red Road came into view, interrupting the wilderness like a wound. Bordered by maroon curbs, the avenue of seamless red pavement began abruptly and extended to the edge of sight, the only evidence of inhabitants in the otherwise untamed landscape. Cole, Dalton, Mira, Jace, Skye, and Joe had avoided serious trouble since parting from Honor and the former Rogue Knight on their way to Zeropolis. Cole hoped that drawing near to Trillian wouldn&#x2019;t end their peaceful streak.<br> <br>He looked to Skye, who considered the road warily. He understood her hesitation. The Lost Palace, longtime prison of Trillian the torivor, awaited at the end. As the new Grand Shaper of Elloweer, Skye was about to ask Trillian to become her teacher.<br> <br>Cole did not envy her. One of the most feared and dangerous beings in the Outskirts, Trillian had been caught off guard by a team of mighty shapers and locked away long ago. Had they failed to imprison him, the torivor probably would have brought the entire Outskirts under his control.<br> <br>Only a few weeks had passed since Cole first visited the Lost Palace and witnessed Trillian&#x2019;s enormous power firsthand. Inside his prison, the torivor could rearrange reality almost without limits. Not only had Trillian invaded his mind, but Cole had risked his life and freedom to rescue Mira&#x2019;s sister Honor from captivity.<br> <br>As a rule, the people of Elloweer stayed far from Trillian&#x2019;s domain. Nobody wanted to risk crossing the torivor or the members of his Red Guard, which was exactly why Joe had suggested their little group of fugitives should accompany Skye to the Lost Palace on their way to Zeropolis. Since Skye had official business with Trillian, Joe had been willing to gamble that the nearness of the torivor posed a lesser threat than traveling through more populated regions.<br> <br>Cole&#x2019;s eyes strayed to Mira, astride her dappled mare. There was no question that her father, the High Shaper, desperately wanted her back. After stealing the shaping powers of his five daughters, Stafford Pemberton had faked their deaths and tried to hold them prisoner. With help from their mother, the daughters had escaped and survived in exile, never aging after their powers were taken.<br> <br>Not only Mira had regained her power&#x2014;her sister Honor had as well. The High Shaper had first sent legionnaires to apprehend Mira, and then sent his secret police, the Enforcers. He now had to be more frantic than ever to find her. Since defeating Morgassa, Cole hadn&#x2019;t seen any agents of the High King, which suggested that the strategy of heading toward the Lost Palace was working.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do we ride on the road?&#x201d; Skye asked, having stopped only a few paces from where the red pavement started.<br> <br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t really need to hide that we&#x2019;re coming,&#x201d; Mira reasoned. &#x201c;Hopefully Trillian will be satisfied to learn he&#x2019;ll have a new Grand Shaper to train.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;Trillian was pretty interested in you and Honor. He can sense people on his road. Is it smart to let him know you&#x2019;re near?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good point,&#x201d; Jace said, sitting tall on his horse, his face serious. &#x201c;Last time, Trillian let you go because he wanted us to stop Morgassa. He might try to retake you and keep you this time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll have more Morgassas to fight if we don&#x2019;t stop my father and his shapecrafters,&#x201d; Mira said. &#x201c;Trillian can read our thoughts. He&#x2019;ll know how important it is we find Constance and my other sisters.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Will that matter as much to him?&#x201d; Dalton asked. &#x201c;Morgassa was a direct threat. He thought she might be able to take him out. Will he care about problems in other kingdoms?&#x201d; <br> <br>&#x201c;I can tell you one thing,&#x201d; Skye said. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t work with Trillian if he tries to hold you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He might not care,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;He can probably find ways to train you whether or not you&#x2019;re willing, Skye. I&#x2019;ve met him. The guy can get inside your mind and take over your dreams. Inside his prison, he can do pretty much whatever he wants. He might be more than happy to capture us no matter how we feel about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We can&#x2019;t afford to make ourselves easy targets,&#x201d; Joe said, the only other adult in the group besides Skye. &#x201c;Taking the road might be a little smoother, but Cole&#x2019;s right&#x2014;we don&#x2019;t need to let Trillian know we&#x2019;re around sooner than necessary.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We traveled beside the road last time,&#x201d; Mira said. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t too bad.&#x201d;<br> <br>The conversation ended there. Joe and Skye started to parallel the road, and the others followed.<br> <br>Dalton brought his horse alongside Cole. &#x201c;Seems like we were just here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It really does.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Minimus was with us last time,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;I wish we had a knight or something.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad he&#x2019;s with Twitch,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;The bully who took over Twitch&#x2019;s village won&#x2019;t know what hit him. But if we&#x2019;re wishing, I&#x2019;d want Twitch here too. He&#x2019;s saved my life more times than anyone.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dalton nodded. &#x201c;If trouble comes, Skye and I can hide us with seemings.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hiding is probably our best bet for now,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;At least until you find your power again.&#x201d;<br> <br>Cole forced a smile, but he didn&#x2019;t love the reminder. Not long ago Cole discovered he had the ability to energize magical items from Sambria so they could work in Elloweer. But right before Morgassa died, she had sunk her fingernails into his sides and somehow used shapecraft to separate him from his power. Just after he had learned to recognize and access the ability, it had vanished.<br> <br>&#x201c;We have the masks,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Only as a last resort,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;Callista warned that the more we use them, the harder they&#x2019;ll be to take off. Plus, she&#x2019;s no longer around to help if something goes wrong.&#x201d;<br> <br>The masks that Callista had given them for their battle against Morgassa could transform them into powerful animals. Looking back at his time as a mountain lion, Cole recalled the experience through a dreamlike haze, running across many miles of Elloweer in a tireless sprint. Dalton was right about the danger&#x2014;neither time he removed the mask had been easy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Last time we were animals, most of us got badly injured,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;Jace and I almost died. We might be just as hurt if we put the masks back on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Only one way to find out,&#x201d; Dalton said. &#x201c;Not that I&#x2019;m in a hurry to test it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Once we make it to the Lost Palace, we&#x2019;ll leave the masks with Skye,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;They won&#x2019;t work in Zeropolis, and they&#x2019;re too powerful to leave randomly stashed someplace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;After that our only defense will be my seemings and Joe,&#x201d; Dalton said.<br> <br>Cole looked ahead at Joe. How old was he? Thirty? He hadn&#x2019;t seemed like an amazing warrior or anything, but he was certainly brave and scrappy. Joe had come to the Outskirts from Monterey, California, but Cole didn&#x2019;t know much else about his history.<br> <br>&#x201c;Think Trillian will give us trouble?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;d be dumb if we didn&#x2019;t expect it,&#x201d; Dalton said.<br> <br>They spent the day with the road on their left, veering closer or farther as obstacles arose. As night fell, they made camp. Bedullah, a large orange moon, eased up into the sky, outshining the nearby stars.<br> <br>Cole noticed Mira standing apart from the camp, her eyes on the heavens. He walked over to her. &#x201c;This is the biggest moon, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>She glanced his way. &#x201c;Bedullah is the biggest I&#x2019;ve seen. It doesn&#x2019;t show up very often. It makes all the stars fainter. An even bigger golden one used to appear sometimes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you looking for your sisters&#x2019; stars?&#x201d; Cole inquired quietly, referring to the heavenly markers that Mira&#x2019;s mother sometimes used to show her daughters&#x2019; locations.<br> <br>&#x201c;Every night,&#x201d; Mira whispered back. &#x201c;Just in case.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t be easy with the stars and moons always changing,&#x201d; Cole said.<br> <br>&#x201c;It isn&#x2019;t. Their stars are always the same color and brightness, but they can be in any direction, and they show up against a different backdrop every night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t get how the Outskirts have such different skies every night.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s not to get?&#x201d; Mira asked, her eyes skyward.<br> <br>&#x201c;On Earth the stars have regular patterns,&#x201d; Cole said. &#x201c;One moon circles us. Here the stars can be anywhere. You have over ten moons that show up when they feel like it. Where do they hide the rest of the time? What kind of universe shifts around during the day into something else?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The heavens here have always been erratic,&#x201d; Mira said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just how it is. It&#x2019;d take somebody smarter than me to explain why.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Any luck with the stars?&#x201d; Cole asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Mira said.<br> <br>Cole studied the sky. He had no idea what to look for. Mira kept the specifics of the stars a secret. If anybody ever learned about the celestial lights occasionally used by Harmony Pemberton, it could prove fatal.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not seeing the stars is a good thing,&#x201d; Mira said. &#x201c;It means my sisters are safe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It also means Constance will be hard to find,&#x201d; Cole replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Then we&#x2019;ll look hard,&#x201d; Mira said. &#x201c;Hopefully we&#x2019;ll find more of your friends, too.&#x201d;<br> <br>Though Cole had found Dalton, he had only crossed the path of one other person who was kidnapped from Mesa with him&#x2014;a girl named Jill. He had offered to rescue her, but she had been too scared to try to escape her position as a slave at a confidence lounge, where she helped create illusionary disguises so people could exchange secrets anonymously.<br> <br>There were still so many people to find! He worried most about Jenna, his friend who had also been his secret crush for years. When they were separated, he had promised to find her but hadn&#x2019;t uncovered any clues yet. Would he finally track her down in Zeropolis?<br> <br>&#x201c;Who goes there?&#x201d; Jace shouted.<br> <br>Turning, Cole saw a form racing toward their camp. Though it was hard to ...</p><h2>Gospel-Powered Parenting: How the Gospel Shapes and Transforms Parenting</h2><p>"How can I hope to be an effective parent today when attack on the family are stronger than ever before?"<br><br>The answer, says Farley, is the gospel.<br><br>Parents who claim the gospel as their own have an enormous effect on their marriage, their integrity, and their love for their children.

He whirled and slashed, maneuvering his steed with precision, all without&nbsp;<i>hakusha</i>, or spurs. The samurai did not use them.</p><p>Clad in brightly painted armor, Yoshiro sported wide shoulder boards, heavy gauntlets and a helmet adorned with stag horns. He wielded a gleaming&nbsp;<i>katana</i>&nbsp;that caught every bit of the light as it cut through the air.</p><p>With a flick of the wrist, he disarmed his nearest adversary. A backhanded cut followed, snapping another opponent&#x2019;s sword in two.&nbsp;As that soldier fled, a third foe lunged at Yoshiro with a pike. The tip struck his ribs, but his scaled armor that lay in pleats prevented mortal damage. Yoshiro wheeled around and killed the man with a downward hack.</p><p>Free for a second, he turned his horse in a tight pirouette. The horse, dressed in armor to match Yoshiro&#x2019;s, reared up, kicking with its front legs and then leaping forward.</p><p>Its iron-clad hooves smashed a pair of attackers in the face, sending them bloodied and battered to the ground. It came down on a third man, crushing him, but enemy soldiers were now massing on all sides.</p><p>Yoshiro turned one way and back again. He&#x2019;d taken the field against the Shogun, who arrived with overwhelming numbers. The battle had gone predictably and Yoshiro was facing the end.</p><p>Determined to take as many foes with him as possible, Yoshiro charged the closest group, but they pulled back in a defensive formation, raising shields and long pikes. He turned and galloped toward another formation of troops, but they, too, held their ground, cowering behind a forest of spears.</p><p><i>Perhaps they meant to capture him. Perhaps the Shogun would demand he commit&nbsp;</i>seppuku<i>&nbsp;in front of the court. Such an end Yoshiro would not accept.</i></p><p>He urged his horse one way and then the other. But with each move,&nbsp;the foot soldiers drew back. Yoshiro pulled up. He had no wish to see his steed uselessly killed. It was a beautiful animal and his only advantage.</p><p>&#x201c;Fight me!&#x201d; he demanded, turning from quarter to quarter. &#x201c;Fight me if you have any honor!&#x201d;</p><p>A primal grunt caught his attention. A spear was hurled his way. With superb reflexes, Yoshiro parried the incoming missile, slicing through the wooden shaft with his sword, both deflecting and dividing it. The weapon fell harmlessly in two pieces.</p><p>&#x201c;Do not attack!&#x201d; a voice shouted from behind the mass of troops. &#x201c;His head belongs to me.&#x201d;</p><p>The soldiers straightened at the sound of the command and one section of the circle opened, allowing the rider to enter.</p><p>Yoshiro recognized the silk draping of the horse, the golden breastplates of the armor and the winged helmet. The Shogun had come to fight at last.</p><p>&#x201c;Kasimoto!&#x201d; Yoshiro called out. &#x201c;I did not think you&#x2019;d have the courage to cross swords with me in person.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I would not allow any other to vanquish a traitor,&#x201d; Kasimoto said, drawing a sword of his own, a&nbsp;<i>katana</i>&nbsp;like Yoshiro&#x2019;s, though it was a darker weapon with a thicker blade. &#x201c;You swore allegiance to me as feudal lord. You are in rebellion.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And you swore to protect the people, not murder them and steal their land.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;My authority is absolute,&#x201d; the Shogun bellowed. &#x201c;Over them and over you. I cannot steal what is already mine. But if you beg for it, I will be merciful.&#x201d;</p><p>The Shogun whistled and a small group of prisoners were brought out. Children. Two boys and two girls. They were forced to kneel while servants of the Shogun stood behind them with daggers.</p><p>&#x201c;I have more than a thousand captives,&#x201d; the Shogun said. &#x201c;And with your rabble defeated, nothing stands between me and the village. If you surrender now and take your own life, I will kill only half the prisoners and leave the village standing. But if you fight me, I will slaughter them to the last man, woman or child and I&#x2019;ll burn the village to ash.&#x201d;</p><p>Yoshiro had known it would come to this. But he also knew that many in the Shogun&#x2019;s ranks had grown weary of the brutality, expecting it to land on them sooner or later. That gave him one flicker of hope. If he could kill the Shogun here and now, wiser minds might prevail. At long last, there might be peace.</p><p>Yoshiro considered his chances. The Shogun was a cunning warrior, strong and possessing great expertise, but he and his horse were unmarked by blood, sweat or soil. It had been a long time since the Shogun fought for his life.</p><p>&#x201c;What answer do you give?&#x201d;</p><p>Yoshiro kicked his horse in the side and charged, raising his gleaming sword above his head.</p><p>The Shogun reacted slowly but deflected the attack at the last �moment and urged his animal forward, passing Yoshiro on the left.</p><p>The warriors swapped sides, turned and charged once again. This time, the armored animals collided at the center of the circle. Both horses buckled from the impact. Their riders were thrown to the ground.</p><p>Yoshiro sprang up first, attacking with a deadly thrust.</p><p>Kasimoto parried the assault and jumped to the side, but Yoshiro spun and slashed downward.</p><p>With each clash of the swords, sparks flew from the blades. The Shogun regained his form and an uppercut from him tore Yoshiro&#x2019;s helmet off, opening a gash on his cheek. A return strike from Yoshiro took off one of Kasimoto&#x2019;s shoulder boards.</p><p>Angered and in pain, the Shogun came on furiously, slashing, feinting and hacking, using a deadly combination.</p><p>Yoshiro reeled from the attack, nearly losing his balance. The Shogun went for his throat with a cut that should have separated head from body, but with a desperate flick of the hands, Yoshiro deflected the strike with the flat side of his sword.</p><p>The impact should have broken his weapon into useless pieces, but Yoshiro&#x2019;s blade took the blow, flexed and deflected the strike away from him.</p><p>In a counterattack, Yoshiro unleashed a powerful crosscut that found Kasimoto&#x2019;s midsection. The edge of the blade was so sharp and the strike so fierce that it gashed through the painted steel plate and the hardened leather, drawing blood from the Shogun&#x2019;s ribs.</p><p>A gasp came from the soldiers gathered around. Kasimoto stumbled back, clutching his side. He gazed at Yoshiro in astonishment. &#x201c;Your blade remains in one piece while my armor is carved like wet cloth. There can only be one reason for that. The rumors are true, you hold the weapon of the great swordmaker. The Masamune.&#x201d;</p><p>Yoshiro held the gleaming sword proudly. &#x201c;This weapon was handed down to me from my father and from his father before him. It&#x2019;s the finest blade of all the Master&#x2019;s works. And it shall bring an end to your vile life.&#x201d;</p><p>The Shogun pulled off his helmet in order to breathe and see better. &#x201c;A powerful weapon indeed,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;One I shall treasure when I pull it from your dead hand&#x2014;but my sword is the greater of the two. It is the blade that thirsts for blood.&#x201d;</p><p>Yoshiro recognized the&nbsp;<i>katana</i>&nbsp;in the Shogun&#x2019;s hands. It was the work of Japan&#x2019;s other great swordsmith: Muramasa, prot�g� to the famed Master.</p><p>It was said the two swordmakers had lived in a state of bitter �contention and that the Muramasa had infused his weapons with the jealousy, hatred and darkness he felt for the one who had taught him. They had become weapons of conquest, destruction and death, where the works of Masamune were used to uphold the righteous and to bring peace.</p><p>Legends to be sure, but there was always some truth to them.</p><p>&#x201c;Trust in that dark sword and it will bring you to ruin,&#x201d; Yoshiro warned.</p><p>&#x201c;Not until it brings me your head.&#x201d;</p><p>The two warriors circled each other, wounded and catching their breath, each of them preparing for the final clash. Yoshiro was limping and Kasimoto bleeding. One would soon fall.</p><p>Yoshiro would have to act decisively. If he missed his mark, Kasimoto would kill him. If he struck a wounding blow, the Shogun would retreat out of fear and order his men to swarm over Yoshiro. If that were to occur, even the magnificent weapon he wielded would be unable to save him.</p><p>He needed a lightning strike. One that would kill the Shogun instantly.</p><p>Limping more noticeably, Yoshiro came to a halt. He assumed the classic samurai stance, one leg back, one leg forward, both hands on the sword, which was kept near the back hip.</p><p>&#x201c;You look tired,&#x201d; the Shogun said.</p><p>&#x201c;Test me.&#x201d;</p><p>The Shogun responded with a defensive stance of his own. He would not take the bait.</p><p>Yoshiro had to act. He lunged forward with surprising speed, the flaps of his layered armor spreading like wings as he charged.</p><p>In close, he thrust the&nbsp;<i>katana</i>&nbsp;at the Shogun&#x2019;s neck, but Kasimoto blocked the attack with an armored gauntlet and brought his own blade downward.</p><p>It sliced into Yoshiro&#x2019;s arm. The pain was excruciating but Yoshiro ignored it. He spun in a full circle and launched into a new assault.</p><p>The Shogun staggered backward under the weight of the attack. He&nbsp;was pushed to the right and then back to the left and then over to the right again. His legs shook. His breath came in gasps.</p><p>Overpowered by the attack, he tumbled, by chance landing beside one of the young prisoners. As Yoshiro began a lethal stroke, the Shogun pulled the child in front of him.</p><p>Yoshiro was already in the process of striking, but the sword caught neither the Shogun&#x2019;s head nor the child&#x2019;s. It continued down, glancing&nbsp;off the Shogun&#x2019;s ankle and plunging its tip into the soft trampled earth.</p><p>Yoshiro pulled, but the blade stuck in the ground for just a second. That was long enough for Kasimoto. He threw the child aside and swung for Yoshiro with both hands on the hilt of his weapon.</p><p>His blade sliced through Yoshiro&#x2019;s neck and took his life instantly. The samurai&#x2019;s headless body fell in a heap. But the dying was not over.</p><p>Kasimoto&#x2019;s forward lunge had brought him up from a crouch. As he stepped down, his ankle buckled where it had been smashed by Yoshiro&#x2019;s final blow. He stumbled forward, reaching out toward the ground to break his fall, and he turned the point of his own sword back toward himself.</p><p>It pierced his chest where Yoshiro had cut the armor away, puncturing his heart, skewering him and holding him off the ground.</p><p>Kasimoto&#x2019;s mouth opened as if to scream, but no sound came forth. He lay there, propped up by his own weapon, his blood running down the length of its curved blade.</p><p>The battle ended this way, as did the war.</p><p>The Shogun&#x2019;s men were tired, weary and now leaderless. They were many weeks from home. Instead of pressing on and burning the village, they gathered up their dead and left, taking with them both the gleaming sword of the Masamune and the blood-soaked weapon forged by Muramasa the apprentice.</p><p>Tales of the battle would grow from that day forward and soon became embellished until the claims were beyond imagination.</p><p>Yoshiro&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>katana</i>&nbsp;would eventually be known as the Honjo Masamune, the ultimate creation of Japan&#x2019;s greatest swordsmith. It was said to be unbreakable and yet able to bend nearly in half as it swung and whipped through the air. One legend insisted it shined from within, casting enough light to blind its opponents. Others said the blade was so finely honed that when Yoshiro held it before him, it split the light into a rainbow and rendered him invisible.</p><p>The Shogun&#x2019;s dark sword would become only slightly less famous. It was a charcoal color to begin with and was said to have grown darker and reddish in tint after soaking in Kasimoto&#x2019;s blood. It came to be called the Crimson Blade. Over the centuries, its own legend would grow. Many who took possession of it came to great wealth and power. And most of them came to tragic ends as well.</p><p>Both weapons would be passed down from samurai to samurai, from feudal lord to feudal lord, becoming national treasures of the Japanese people. They would be held by the powerful families, revered by the public and prized, until they vanished without a trace in the chaotic days at the end of World War II.</p></p><h2>The Aging Brain: Proven Steps to Prevent Dementia and Sharpen Your Mind</h2><p>While growing older is inevitable, many of the troubles we associate with aging--including dementia, disability, and an increased dependence on others--are not.

Consequently the population rises, keeping living standards low, poverty widespread, and starvation and disease common. <br><br> Henry George had a different attitude: that poverty could be solved and economic progress preserved. To prove this, he draws upon decades of data which show that the increase in land prices restrains the amount of production on said land; business owners thus have less to pay their workers, with the result being mass poverty especially within cities. <br><br> The radical solution George proposes is a land value tax, whereby owners of land must pay a levy on their holdings. Thus money is diverted directly from landowners, to be spent on alleviating the poverty of workers, improving the infrastructure and environment of urban and rural areas, and even giving every citizen a basic income to cover their necessities. <br><br> George is also concerned with the cyclical nature of the economy, which by the latter part of the 19th century clearly followed cycles of boom and bust. This instability is further aggravated by spikes in land prices and consequently rents, whereby both producers - such as factory builders and farmers - and workers are displaced. Thus, Henry George doubles down on his idea for the land value tax, highlighting its efficiency and the fact that land - unlike resources or labor - is a fixed and easily quantified thing. <br><br> Divided into ten books, which in turn comprise between two and five chapters each, Progress and Poverty sequentially proposes, and discusses the implementations, of this economic reform. The book was enormously popular with the American public; written in a plain but engaging style, the powerful argument George makes would impact economists and the public consciousness alike for decades to follow.</p><p>In this volume three very different aspects of the late nineteenth-century debate on poverty are bound together: the American Henry George&#39;s Progress and Poverty, a response by a British businessman, Isaac B. Cooke, and a description by Andrew Mearns of the reality of poverty in the world&#39;s richest city.</p><h2>Fables: Legends in Exile, Vol. 1</h2><p><b>When a savage creature known only as the Adversary conquered the fabled lands of legends and fairy tales, all of the infamous inhabitants of folklore were forced into exile. Disguised among the "mundys," their name for normal citizens of modern-day New York, these magical characters created their own secret society that they call Fabletown. From their exclusive luxury apartment buildings on Manhattan's Upper West Side, these creatures of legend must fight for their survival in the new world. <br><br><i>Fables </i>is the winner of 14 Eisner Awards and is one of the most enduring Vertigo titles ever. Here, in this new, 10th anniversary edition, is a newly colored 8-page story from the <i>Fables </i>prose work <i>Peter &amp; Max</i>: <i>A Fables Novel</i>, as well as a beautiful new cover from series artist Mark Buckingham.&nbsp;<br><br></b></p><p>Bill Willingham is the award-winning writer and creator of <i>Fables</i>. He has been writing, and sometimes drawing, comics for more than twenty years on titles including <i>Elementals</i>, <i>Coventry</i>, <i>Proposition </i>PLAYER and <i>Fables</i>. With Matthew Sturges, Bill co-wrote the <i>Fables</i> spinoff <i>Jack Of Fables</i>, as well as <i>House Of Mystery</i> and <i>Justice Society Of America</i>. His work has been nominated for many awards, including the Eisner, Harvey and Ignatz comic industry awards, plus the International Horror Guild award.This elaborate fantasy series begins as a whodunit, but quickly unfurls into a much larger story about Fabletown, a place where fairy tale legends live alongside regular New Yorkers. Years ago, fables and fairy tales like Jack and the Beanstalk and Cinderella "were a thousand separate kingdoms spread over a hundred magic worlds," until they were invaded and driven into hiding and, eventually, into modern-day Gotham. And so, on the city streets we find Beauty and the Beast in trouble with the law and Prince Charming reduced to a broke cad auctioning off his royal title, while his ex-wife, Snow White, rules over the de facto kingdom the fables created. When Snow White's sister, Rose Red, disappears from a blood-soaked apartment, the Wolf, reformed and now the kingdom's house detective, is assigned to the case. Willingham uses the Wolf's investigation to introduce readers to Fabletown's dissolute, hard-luck inhabitants, and he is at his best here, relishing one-liners and spinning funky background information of a world where fairy tale characters spend their time fretting about money and thinking up get-rich schemes. The mystery seems mostly an excuse to delineate Willingham's world, as the caper is easily resolved-in true fairy tale fashion-during a massive ballroom celebration. Willingham's dialogue is humorous, his characterizations are sharp and his plot encompasses a tremendous amount of information with no strain at all. The art, mostly by Medina and Leialoha, is well drawn and serviceable, if somewhat unremarkable, with occasional flares of decorative invention. But it's Willingham's script that carries the tale. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Shakespeare Book: Big Ideas Simply Explained (DK Big Ideas)</h2><p><p><i>The Shakespeare Book</i> brings the work of William Shakespeare to life with full-color photography, images, idea webs, timelines, and quotes that help you understand the context of Shakespeare's plays and poems.</p><p>From Shakespeare's most-famous plays, such as <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and <i>Julius Caesar</i>, to less-frequently performed works such as <i>King John</i> and <i>Henry VIII</i>, every play of the Shakespearean canon is collected in this comprehensive guide, along with his major poems and best-loved sonnets.</p><p>In <i>The Shakespeare Book</i> each play includes an at-a-glance guide to story chronology, so you can easily get back on track if you get lost in Shakespeare's language.

Her concise introduction to these meditations contains an astounding amount of valuable information about grieving. Contradicting many of the standard grieving myths, she isn't sugar-coating any of it or telling readers to get over it. Instead, she tells us that the pain doesn't stop, that there is no closure. She tells us that the goal is merging the loss into our lives and eventually transcending the pain. The 365 meditations she has put together gently take readers through the journey of getting to know grief and accept it. Each meditation ends with a one sentence daily affirmation.

They relentlessly pursue that one dream, achieve it, and spend their lives living out their vocations.&nbsp; My life has been a bit more circuitous than that, as I imagine yours has been. Even those who appear to be living with singular purpose and direction probably have lives more circuitous than they appear. The truth is that our lives have been shaped and directed by multiple "callings." I have at various times, been intentional in discerning and pursuing a call to be a teacher, wife, mother, and minister.&nbsp; Sometimes, as with my call to be a teacher, those callings come deep from within and are just a part of how we are created. They simply cannot be denied. And sometimes, as with my calling to be a minister, we wonder where in the world that seemingly crazy idea came from, and we need to spend time determining if it is God's call we hear or just our imagination gone wild! This book was inspired by the joys and struggles I encountered in my own call to ministry and the ways the narratives of six biblical characters have informed and given shape to my own faith journey. Answering God's call has led me to places in life and in ministry that I could never have imagined. Through these six stories we see God interrupting the lives of ordinary men and women, people like you and me, calling them to and empowering them for unique and extraordinary lives of service that bring hope and transformation to the world.&nbsp; As you read these stories, I hope you will see yourself in each of the biblical characters. May you experience the intimacy of God's voice in your ear. May you know that you are &nbsp;a beloved and invaluable agent in bringing God's kingdom on earth as it is in heaven. May you be awed to know and experience that the God of the universe, the same God who called Abraham, Samuel, and Mary Magdalene, calls you too, to an extraordinary life you could never imagine on your own.&nbsp; These stories of faith are a constant source of encouragement and inspiration in my faith journey, and I hope they will be for you as well.<i>Susan Robb is a gifted pastor and storyteller.

The eccentric penguin yet again finds a way to save the day as the hunters make their way to ruin a very festive, and very haunted, Halloween. This engaging tale has a timely twist that will certainly incur some giggles as the penguins dress up as what they are most afraid of; kids will relate to fears of the dark, thunderstorms, monsters, and in Perfect's case&#x2014;bubbles. Turning their fears into silly costumes will open up the possibilities for young readers to discuss their own fears and how to face them just as Tacky does. As usual, Tacky's entrance is timely and funny, as his costume turns out to be the best of all even after the penguin has a big think (aka a nap).

First published less than a year after the infamous verdict, Jeffrey Toobin&#x2019;s nonfiction masterpiece tells the whole story, from the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman to the ruthless gamesmanship behind the scenes of &#x201c;the trial of the century.&#x201d; Rich in character, as propulsive as a legal thriller, this enduring narrative continues to shock and fascinate with its candid depiction of the human drama that upended American life.<br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>Praise for <i>The Run of His Life</i></b><br> <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><br> &#x201c;This is the book to read.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i> </b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;This book stands out as a gripping and colorful account of the crime and trial that captured the world&#x2019;s attention.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Boston Sunday Globe</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;A real page-turner . . . strips away the months of circuslike televised proceedings and the sordid tell-all books and lays out a simple, but devastating, synopsis of the case.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></b><br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> &#x201c;A well-written, profoundly rational analysis of the trial and, more specifically, the lawyers who conducted it.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>USA Today</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Engrossing . . . Toobin&#x2019;s insight into the motives and mind-set of key players sets this Simpson book apart from the pack.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>People </i>(one of the top ten books of the year)</b></p><p>Just when you thought everyone and their second-cousin had published a book on the most famous criminal proceding of the century, along comes a book about the trial that actually deserves to be read. <p> Jeffrey Toobin's coverage of the trial of O.J. Simpson for <b>The New Yorker</b> magazine was the first to focus on the reality that no one wanted to addresss directly, but that pervaded every moment of the trial and perhaps even the crime itself - that race was at the heart of everything. Toobin's explosive article in July 1994, "An Incendiary Defense," laid out the defense lawyers' strategy, fingered Mark Fuhrman as their chief villain, and made the "race card" the euphemism of choice. </p><p> In <b>The Run of His Life</b>, Toobin's reporting, based on his unprecedented access to sources to the sources on all sides, lets us see, in a fresh light, the prosecutors, defense attorneys, private eyes, waiters, dog walkers, cops, ex-football stars, TV personalities, forensic experts, and so many others. He also offers an insightful examination of the larger questions raised by the case - including the importance of celebrity, race (and the way it's manipulated in the media), California as both a state and a state of mind, domestic violence, American jurisprudence, and the efficacy of the jury system.</p>It has been the most closely-watched and controversial legal proceeding of our time, and Jeffrey Toobin has written the definite history of what has become the trial of the century. Here is the whole story of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman and their aftermath, as it has never been told -- rich in character, driven by the nonstop plot of a legal thriller, and nuanced by the foibles, vanities, and idiosyncrasies of its participants. Featuring a new chapter on the O.J. Simpson civil trial, <i>The Run of His Life</i> -- hailed by <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> as "the pick of the litter" -- is a breathtakingly paced narrative that will long outlast the daily headlines.</p><h2>To a Thousand Generations: Infant Baptism - Covenant Mercy for the People of God</h2><p>For years, Douglas Wilson was a credobaptist, even after accepting Calvinism and Postmillennialism. However, when he sat down to write a book on baptism, he came to question his own views and to realize that the Biblical teachings point in exactly the opposite direction. The result of that study is this book, <i>To a Thousand Generations</i>.<p></p><p>In this short book, he shows that we do not get the Bible's position on baptism by cataloging all the verses on baptism, but by looking at circumcision, the shift from the old to the new covenant, Jesus' words on olive branches, and the assumptions that New Testament Christians would have had.</p></p><p><b>Douglas Wilson</b> is a Senior Fellow of theology at New Saint Andrews College. Wilson is the author of numerous books on education, theology, and culture, including: <i>The Case for Classical Christian Education</i>, <i>Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning</i>, <i>Mother Kirk</i>, and <i>Angels in the Architecture</i>, as well as biographies on both Anne Bradstreet and John Knox.</p><h2>Shades of Light: A Novel</h2><p><em><strong>"I was desperate. . . . I couldn't turn off the dark thoughts, no matter how hard I tried or how much I prayed.</strong> And then I spent a whole weekend in bed, and the crying wouldn't stop, and I got really scared. I've had bouts with depression before&#x2015;it's kind of a cloud I've learned to live with&#x2015;but this time was different. I felt like I was going under, like I'd never feel hopeful again, and then that just made my anxiety worse and it all spiraled from there."</em> Wren Crawford is a social worker who finds herself overwhelmed with the troubles of the world. Her lifelong struggles with anxiety and depression are starting to overcome her. She finds solace in art, spiritual formation, and pastoral care along with traditional therapeutic interventions. But a complicated relationship from her past also threatens to undo her progress. Fans of Sharon Brown's bestselling Sensible Shoes Series will be delighted to discover some old friends along the way. As Wren seeks healing in this beautifully written novel, readers are invited to move beyond pat answers and shallow theology into an experience of hope and presence that illuminates even the darkness.</p><p>Sharon Garlough Brown is a spiritual director, speaker, and cofounder of Abiding Way Ministries, providing spiritual formation retreats and resources. She is the author of the bestselling Sensible Shoes Series, which includes spiritual fiction novels <em>Sensible Shoes</em>, <em>Two Steps Forward</em>, <em>Barefoot</em>, <em>An Extra Mile</em>, and their study guides. A graduate of Princeton Theological Seminary, Sharon has served on the pastoral staff of congregations in Scotland, Oklahoma, England, and most recently in West Michigan, where she copastored with her husband, Jack, for many years."This novel skillfully tackles the dark topics of depression and suicide as well as the often misguided way Christians treat mental illness. It asks the hard questions such as how one should support a loved one who deals with this disease and what to do when our best intentions are ineffective in providing help and solace. Beautiful and haunting, <em>Shades of Light</em> is a heart-wrenching and necessary read that ultimately offers hope." (Elizabeth Musser, author of The Long Highway Home)<br><br>"Sharon Garlough Brown uses the vulnerable, sensitive, compassionate, and creative character of Wren to sympathetically immerse the reader into her valiant struggles of coping with depression and anxiety. With Wren's deep insights into the life of Vincent van Gogh, we are invited to participate in the illuminating potential of <em>visio divina</em> to experience the comforting aspects of Vincent's art. Sharon succeeds in revealing what hides beneath the surface of the two wounded and kindred spirits&#x2015;Wren and Vincent&#x2015;namely, their compassion and their spiritual and intellectual depth. This is a book that compels us to be more compassionate and less judgmental." (Carol A. Berry, lecturer, author of Learning from Henri Nouwen and Vincent van Gogh: A Portrait of the Compassionate Life)<br><br>"Sharon Garlough Brown's <em>Shades of Light</em> is a rare and beautiful study in contrasts. Faith and doubt, control and surrender, acceptance and resistance&#x2015;all are woven into the darks and lights of a story so real and provoking that you will find yourself aching, wondering, hoping, and even praying alongside her luminescent characters. The struggles of depression and anxiety, of parenting and being parented, of loving and losing aren't tied up in easy answers or simple narratives, but are lifted up for what they are: the beloved brokenness where God's light and love get in." (Tara Owens, author of Embracing the Body)<br><br>"Christians have not done well with the subject of mental illness. There is a great deal of stigma around the therapy process, calling people's struggles 'a lack of faith' or 'sin in their life.' This marvelous book courageously unveils the reality of psychological struggle even among people of faith, pointing us to the Jesus who keeps company with us in everything that is hard&#x2015;a companion in sorrow. Thank you, Sharon, for this work that I predict will be healing to many." (James Bryan Smith, author of The Good and Beautiful God)<br><br>"In <em>Shades of Light</em>, Sharon Garlough Brown draws us once again into stories of faith amid suffering and hope even in the darkness. Christians face mental illness like everyone else, but too often they wrestle alone and ashamed. As we enter Wren's world of anxiety and depression, we are invited to join her muse Vincent van Gogh and the characters from the Sensible Shoes series as her 'companions in sorrow.' Sharon's unflinching and compassionate portrayal of that sacred fellowship reveals Christ himself is with us on the journey, sharing our tears and holding us in love." (Rebecca Konyndyk DeYoung, author of Glittering Vices)<br><br>"<em>Shades of Light</em> is a beautiful, moving story filled with Sharon Garlough Brown's deep, spiritual insights. As a fan of artist Vincent van Gogh, I loved how the main characters, Wren and her mother, Jamie, drew from the faith of this 'companion in sorrow' as they faced the challenges of Wren's depression. Brown offers no pat answers to the questions raised by mental illness, but shows how joy and suffering are held in delicate balance through faith in the 'Man of Sorrows,' who is 'sorrowful but always rejoicing.' This is a powerful book, triumphant with hope." (Lynn Austin, author of Legacy of Mercy)<br><br>"What a consolation this novel will be for those who have known the darkness! Too often church people approach mental illness with fear, simplistic theology, and useless spiritual bromides. By telling Wren's story, Sharon Garlough Brown instead gently welcomes us into a companionship of sorrow where we can glimpse the dark beauties of grace. There's bracing truth here about the stubbornness of mental illness, the spiritual and practical implications, the helpless ache of those who love but can't fix. But there's also beauty of soul, which emerges for readers through Wren's sensitive dwelling in the paintings and writings of Vincent van Gogh. And as we learn to dwell in Wren's world, to enter that circle of sorrow, we find at the center of it the compassionate, Gethsemane presence of Christ." (Debra Rienstra, professor of English at Calvin College, author of So Much More: An Invitation to Christian Spirituality)<br><br>"Look for cameos by some of your favorite characters from the Sensible Shoes series in this quiet, honest story about the hallowing of the soul in its journey with Jesus through suffering. For anyone who has faced the darkness of depression or walked that road with a loved one, this is a beautiful, much-needed Christian vision of mental illness as both clinical (therefore treatable) and spiritual." (Sarah Arthur, Christianity Today fiction judge, author of A Light So Lovely: The Spiritual Legacy of Madeleine L'Engle)<br><br>"Brown's evocative prose . . . is both heartbreaking and enthralling. This emotionally harrowing story will appeal to fans of Karen Kingsbury."

Author Matt Tommey is quoted as saying "Over the years, I&#x2019;ve encountered many artists, musicians, craftsmen and other creative ones who have, for one reason or another, become stuck. The &#x2018;stuckness&#x2019; originates from many different places &#x2013; woundedness, fear, control, unbelief, religious barriers &#x2013; and creates a frustration in their life that becomes unbearable. Many artists, unable to understand what&#x2019;s really going on either run headlong into &#x2018;creativity for creativities sake&#x2019; or turn to unhealthy alternatives in order to numb or overcome the pain they are feeling. Many more simply give up, hide the gift by stuffing it down under &#x2018;Christian work ethic&#x2019; and just try to gone on with life as usual. Whatever their flavor of &#x2018;stuckness&#x2019;, the Father wants His artists to be fully released to worship Him through their creative expression. His desire is that nothing holds them back from the creative destiny for their life. If you're an artist, it&#x2019;s time to walk in the destiny and fullness that God&#x2019;s designed for you. Your heart beating fast, your imagination vivid, your eyes wide with wonder and desire &#x2013; that&#x2019;s His desire for you! A life fully alive, fully engaged, fully embracing the creative destiny He&#x2019;s given you. He&#x2019;s been waiting for this moment your whole life.&#x201d;</p><p>Matt Tommey has been engaged in creative ministry for many years in both in the US and internationally as a worship leader, songwriter and visual artisan. He is the author of &#x201c;Unlocking the Heart of the Artist&#x201d;, "Crafting Your Brand" and Founder/Executive Director of The Worship Studio (http://www.theworshipstudio.org).

This second part of The Book of Lost Tales includes the tale of Beren and Luthien, Turin and the Dragon, and the only full narratives of the Necklace of the Dwarves and the Fall of Gondolin, itself the finest and most exciting depiction of a battle that Tolkien ever wrote. Each tale is followed by a commentary in the form of a short essay, together with texts of associated poems, and contains extensive information on names and vocabulary in the earliest Elvish languages. This series of fascinating books has now been repackaged to complement the distinctive and classic style of the &#39;black cover&#39; A-format paperbacks of The Hobbit, The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales.</p><p>This second part of THE BOOK OF LOST TALES includes the tale of Beneren and Luthien, Turin and the Dragon, Necklace of the Dwarves, and the Fall of Gondolin.

You may think you have an idea, but aren&#39;t positive that you are fulfilling the purpose for which God created you. First of all, you have to find the unique purpose that He created you for. In his new book, Andrew Wommack teaches you how to do just that. Once you find the will of God for your life, then you will have the assurance and joy that comes from knowing exactly where God wants you to be. As you follow the will of God for your life, it allows you to set goals and purposely seek after what God has created you to do. Andrew teaches you that the number one way that we learn to follow God&#39;s will is to simply put God first. When you put Him first then the desire of your heart changes to match up with His. Lastly, Andrew teaches how to fulfill the will of God in your life. It&#39;s one thing to find God&#39;s will and start moving in the right direction, but it&#39;s something else to stay at it over the long haul. Anybody can start, but it&#39;s the people who finish that really make a difference. Finishing is more important than starting, and it is only through faith and patience that you inherit God&#39;s promises.</p><p>Most people have lost a sense of destiny, God's will for their lives. Many even believe you just can't know God's will - that in His sovereignty, He will make it happen regardless of what you do. Too long this viewpoint has kept Christians from knowing the full potential He planned for them. But no more. God created you with a specific purpose, and the good new is, He wants you to find it. <p> Just knowing God's will, however, isn't enough. You need to understand the part you play if you're going to follow it. You might be surprised to learn it involves following the desires of your heart. But before you set off, make sure you're able to distinguish His will from your own selfish desires. </p><p> One of the most important lessons of all is that you can't fulfill God's will any way you want. His strength and timing, and your obedience and patience are just a few of the things it takes. This book explains all this and much more, including how Andrew found, has followed, and is fulfilling God's will for his life. This will help you on your way to doing just the same!</p>For over three decades Andrew Wommack has traveled America and the world teaching the truth of the gospel.

Sir Charles Baskerville has been found dead. There are no signs of violence, but his face is hideously distorted with terror. Years earlier, a hound-like beast with blazing eyes and dripping jaws was reported to have torn out the throat of Hugo Baskerville. Has the spectral destroyer struck again? More important, is Sir Henry Baskerville, younger heir to the estate, now in danger?<br>Enter Sherlock Holmes, summoned to protect Sir Henry from the fate that has threatened the Baskerville family. As Holmes and Watson begin to investigate, a blood-chilling howl from the fog-shrouded edges of the great Grimpen Mire signals that the legendary hound of the Baskervilles is poised for yet another murderous attack.<br><i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> first appeared as a serial in <i>The Strand Magazine </i>in 1901. By the time of its publication in book form eight months later, this brilliantly plotted, richly atmospheric detective story had already achieved the status of a classic. It has often been called the best detective story ever written. It remains a thrilling tale of suspense, must reading for every lover of detective fiction.</p><p>We owe 1902's <i>The Hound of the Baskervilles</i> to Arthur Conan Doyle's good friend Fletcher "Bobbles" Robinson, who took him to visit some scary English moors and prehistoric ruins, and told him marvelous local legends about escaped prisoners and a 17th-century aristocrat who fell afoul of the family dog. Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?<p> Many Holmes fans prefer Doyle's complete short stories, but their clockwork logic doesn't match the author's boast about this novel: it's "a real Creeper!" What distinguishes this particular <i>Hound</i> is its fulfillment of Doyle's great debt to Edgar Allan Poe--it's full of ancient woe, low moans, a Grimpen Mire that sucks ponies to Dostoyevskian deaths, and locals digging up Neolithic skulls without next-of-kins' consent. "The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the moor sink into one's soul," Watson realizes. "Rank reeds and lush, slimy water-plants sent an odour of decay ... while a false step plunged us more than once thigh-deep into the dark, quivering mire, which shook for yards in soft undulations around our feet ... it was as if some malignant hand was tugging us down into those obscene depths." Read on--but, reader, watch your step! <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>For generations the curse had hung over the Baskerville family. Now another life had been claimed by the mysterious and terrifying beast. Was it a demon or an animal lurking on the descolate moor? Would the new master of the Baskerville home be its next victim?<p></p><p>Sherlock Holmes and Watson set out to solve the most bewildering and bloodcurdling case of their careers in this world-famous classic of mystery and suspense.</p></p><h2>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals: Eighth Edition</h2><p><p>A respected resource for decades, the <i>Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals</i> has been updated by a committee of experts, taking into consideration input from the scientific and laboratory animal communities and the public at large.

People started turning into zoms, the zoms ate just about everyone, everyone who dies becomes a zom, so the moral of this tale is: Try not to die.&#x201d;<br> <br>Across the kitchen table, his brother, Tom, stared at him with narrowed eyes. &#x201c;Are you deliberately trying to be an idiot, or is it a natural gift?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious. We know what happened.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really? Then how come you spent most of last summer complaining that no one my age tells anyone your age the truth about the living dead?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Telling us is one thing. Essays and pop quizzes are a whole different thing.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because heaven forbid you should have to remember anything we told you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Benny raised his eyebrows mysteriously and tapped his temple. &#x201c;I have it all right here in the vast storehouse of knowledge that is me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, boy genius, then what started the plague?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Easy one,&#x201d; Benny said. &#x201c;Nobody knows.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What are the leading theories?&#x201d;<br> <br>Benny jabbed his fork into a big piece of buttered yam, shoved it into his mouth, and chewed noisily as he spoke. It was a move calculated to annoy Tom in three separate ways. Tom hated when he spoke with his mouth full. He hated it when Benny chewed with his mouth open. And it would muffle most of what he said, which meant that Tom had to pay even more attention to the yam-packed mouth from which the muffled words came.<br> <br>&#x201c;Radiation, virus, bioweapon, toxic waste, solar flares, act of God.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rattled it off so there was no break between the words. Also annoying, and worth at least another point on Benny&#x2019;s personal Annoy-O-Meter.<br> <br>Tom sipped his tea and said nothing, but he gave Benny the <i>look</i>.<br> <br>Benny sighed and swallowed. &#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;at first people thought it was radiation from a satellite.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Space probe,&#x201d; corrected Tom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever. But that doesn&#x2019;t make sense, because one satellite&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Space probe.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t carry enough radioactive material to spread over the entire world.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We think.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; conceded Benny, &#x201c;but in science class they told us even if one of the old nuclear power plants did a whatchamacallit, there&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Meltdown.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;wouldn&#x2019;t be enough radiation to cover the entire planet even though it has more radioactive materials than a satellite.&#x201d;<br> <br>Tom sighed. Benny smiled.<br> <br>&#x201c;What conclusion can you draw from that?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The world wasn&#x2019;t destroyed by radioactive alien space zombies.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;<i>Probably</i> wasn&#x2019;t destroyed by radioactive alien space zombies,&#x201d; Tom corrected. &#x201c;How about a virus?&#x201d;<br> <br>Benny cut a piece of chicken and ate it. Tom was a great cook, and this was one of his better meals. Yams, broiled chicken with mushrooms and almonds, and rich green kale. A loaf of steaming bread made from the last of the winter wheat sat near where Benny could plunder it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Chong&#x2019;s dad says that a virus needs a living host, and zoms aren&#x2019;t alive. He said that maybe bacteria or a fungus was sustaining the virus.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you know what a bacterium is?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure ... it&#x2019;s a bug thingy that makes you sick.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;God, I love it when you display the depth of your knowledge. It makes me proud to be your brother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Kiss my&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Language.&#x201d;<br> <br>They grinned at each other.<br> <br>It had been nearly seven months since Benny&#x2019;s lifelong hatred and distrust of Tom had transformed into affection and respect. That process had started last summer, shortly after Benny&#x2019;s fifteenth birthday. On some level Benny knew that he loved Tom, but since Tom was his brother and this was still the real world, the chances of Benny ever using that <i>L</i> word were somewhere between &#x201c;no way&#x201d; and &#x201c;get out of my way I&#x2019;m going to throw up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Not that Benny was afraid of the <i>L</i> word when it came to someone better suited for it, namely the fiercely red-haired queen of freckles, Nix Riley. Benny would like very much to toss that word up for her to consider, but he had yet to do so. Shortly after the big fight at the bounty hunters&#x2019; camp, when Benny had tentatively tried to bring up the subject, Nix had threatened bodily harm if he said that word. Benny had zipped his mouth shut, understanding completely why the moment had been so inappropriate. Charlie Pink-eye Matthias and the Motor City Hammer had murdered Nix&#x2019;s mother, and the insane events of the days that followed hadn&#x2019;t allowed Nix to properly react. Or grieve.<br> <br>Those days had been the weirdest mix of absolute horror, black despair, and soaring happiness. The emotions he&#x2019;d felt didn&#x2019;t seem to even belong in the same world, let alone the same person.<br> <br>Benny gave Nix her time for grief, and he grieved too. Mrs. Riley had been a great lady. Sweet, funny, kind, and always a little sad. Like everyone else in Mountainside, Jessie Riley had suffered terrible losses during First Night. Her husband, her two sons.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everyone lost someone,&#x201d; Chong often reminded him. Even though they&#x2019;d been toddlers, Benny and Chong were the only ones among their friends to remember that night. Chong said that it was all a blur of screams and shouts, but Benny remembered it with a peculiar clarity. His mother handing him through a first-floor window to Tom&#x2014;who was a twenty-year-old cadet at the police academy&#x2014;and then the pale, shambling thing that had been Dad coming out of the shadows and pulling Mom away. Then Tom running away, his terrified heartbeat hammering like a drum inside the chest to which he held a squirming, screaming Benny.<br> <br>Until last year Benny had remembered that First Night in a twisted way. All his life he had believed that Tom had simply run away. That he had not tried to help Mom. That he was a coward.<br> <br>Now Benny knew different. Now he knew what kind of torment Tom had suffered to save him. He also knew that when Mom had handed him through the window to Tom, she had already been bitten. She was already lost. Tom had done the only thing he could have done. He ran, and in running had given value to Mom&#x2019;s sacrifice, and that had saved them both.<br> <br>Now Benny was fifteen and a half, and First Night was a million years ago.<br> <br>This world was no longer that world. On First Night the old world had died. As the dead rose, the living perished. Cities were incinerated by the military in a futile attempt to stop the growing armies of the dead. The electromagnetic pulses from the nukes fried all electronics. The machines went silent, and soon, so did the whole country. Now everything east of the small town of Mountainside was the great Rot and Ruin. A few other towns littered the foothills of the Sierra Nevada north and south of Benny&#x2019;s home, but the rest of the old world had been consumed.<br> <br>Or ... had it?<br> <br>During that adventure in the mountains east of town, Benny and Nix had seen something that to them was as inexplicable and potentially world-changing as the zombie plague had been. Flying high, high above them had been a thing Benny had only ever read about in old books.<br> <br>A jet.<br> <br>A sleek jumbo jet that flew out of the east, banked in a slow circle around the mountains, and then headed back the way it had come. Now Benny and Nix were counting down the days until they left Mountainside to find where the jet had come from. The calendar pinned to the wall by the back door had black <i>X</i>s over the first ten days of this month. There were seven unmarked days, and then a big red circle around the following Saturday. April 17, one week from today. The words ROAD TRIP were written in block letters below the date.<br> <br>Tom thought that the jet was flying in the general direction of Yosemite National Park, which was due east of the town. Benny and Nix had begged Tom for this trip for months, but as the day approached, Benny wasn&#x2019;t so sure he still wanted to go. It was just that Nix was absolutely determined.<br> <br>&#x201c;Earth to Benny Imura.&#x201d;<br> <br>Benny blinked and heard as an after-echo the sound of Tom snapping his fingers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jeez ... what planet were you orbiting?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh ... just kind of drifted there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nix or the jet?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Little of both.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Must have been more about the jet,&#x201d; Tom said. &#x201c;There was less drool.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You are very nearly funny,&#x201d; said Benny. He looked down at his plate and was mildly surprised that it was empty.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; said Tom, &#x201c;you were eating on autopilot. It was fascinating to watch.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a knock on the door. Benny shot to his feet and crossed the kitchen to the back door. He was smiling as he undid the locks.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s got to be Nix,&#x201d; he said as he pulled it open. &#x201c;Hey, sweetie ...&#x201d;<br> <br>Morgie Mitchell and Lou Chong stood on the back porch. &#x201c;Um,&#x201d; said Chong, &#x201c;hello to you, too, sugar lumps.&#x201d;<br> <br>� 2011 Jonathan Maberry</p><h2>Financial Shenanigans, Fourth Edition: How to Detect Accounting Gimmicks and Fraud in Financial Reports</h2><p><b><br></b><b>The bestselling classic from the &#x201c;Sherlock Holmes of Accounting&#x201d;&#x2015;updated to reflect the key case studies and most important lessons from the past quarter century.</b><b><br></b>This fourth edition of the classic guide shines a light on the most shocking frauds and financial reporting offenders of the last twenty-five years, and gives investors the tools they need to detect:<br>�Corporate cultures that incentivize dishonest practices�The latest tricks companies use to exaggerate revenue and earnings�Techniques devised by management to manipulate cash flow as easily as earnings�Companies that use misleading metrics to fool investors about their financial performance�How companies use acquisitions to hide deterioration in their underlying business<br>This new edition focuses on the key case studies and most important lessons from the past quarter century, and brings you up to date on accounting chicanery in the global markets.

Borg and John Dominic Crossan join once again to present a new understanding of early Christianity&#x2014;this time to reveal a radical Paul who has been suppressed by the church.</p><p>Paul is second only to Jesus as the most important person in the birth of Christianity, and yet he continues to be controversial, even among Christians. How could the letters of Paul be used both to inspire radical grace and to endorse systems of oppression&#x2014;condoning slavery, subordinating women, condemning homosexual behavior? Borg and Crossan use the best of biblical and historical scholarship to explain the reasons for Paul's mixed reputation and reveal to us what scholars have known for decades: that the later letters of Paul were created by the early church to dilute Paul's egalitarian message and transform him into something more "acceptable." They argue there are actually "Three Pauls" in the New Testament: "The Radical Paul" (of the seven genuine letters), "The Conservative Paul" (of the three disputed epistles), and "The Reactionary Paul" (of the three inauthentic letters). By closely examining this progression of Paul's letters&#x2014;from the authentic to the inauthentic&#x2014;the authors show how the apostle was slowly but steadily "deradicalized" to fit Roman social norms in regards to slavery, patriarchy, and patronage. In truth, Paul was an appealing apostle of Jesus whose vision of life "in Christ"&#x2014;one of his favored phrases&#x2014;is remarkably faithful to the message of Jesus himself.</p><p>Marcus J. Borg (1942&#x2013;2015) was a pioneering author and teacher whom the <em>New York Times</em> described as "a leading figure in his generation of Jesus scholars." He was the Hundere Distinguished Professor of Religion and Culture at Oregon State University and canon theologian at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral in Portland, and he appeared on NBC's <em>The Today Show</em> and <em>Dateline</em>, ABC's <em>World News</em>, and NPR's <em>Fresh Air</em>. His books have sold over a million copies, including the bestselling <em>Meeting Jesus Again for the First Time</em>, <em>Reading the Bible Again for the First Time</em>, <em>Jesus</em>, <em>The Heart of Christianity</em>, <em>Evolution of the Word</em>, <em>Speaking Christian</em>, and <em>Convictions</em>.</p><br><br><p>John Dominic Crossan, professor emeritus at DePaul University, is widely regarded as the foremost historical Jesus scholar of our time. He is the author of several bestselling books, including <em>The Historical Jesus</em>, <em>How to Read the Bible and Still Be a Christian, God and Empire</em>, <em>Jesus: A Revolutionary Biography</em>, <em>The Greatest Prayer, The Last Week, </em>and <em>The Power of Parable</em>. He lives in Minneola, Florida.</p></p><h2>The Blood Gospel: The Order of the Sanguines Series (Order of the Sanguines Series, 1)</h2><p><i> New York Times</i> bestselling authors James Rollins and Rebecca Cantrell combine their talents in a gothic tale about anancient order and the hunt for a miraculous book known only as . . . The Blood Gospel.<br><br>An earthquake in Masada, Israel, kills hundreds and reveals a tomb buried in the heart of the mountain. A trio of investigators--Sergeant Jordan Stone, a military forensic expert; Father Rhun Korza, a Vatican priest; and Dr. Erin Granger, a brilliant but disillusioned archaeologist--are sent to explore the macabre discovery, a subterranean temple holding the crucified body of a mummified girl.<br><br>But a brutal attack at the site sets the three on the run, thrusting them into a race to recover what was once preserved in the tomb's sarcophagus: a book rumored to have been written by Christ's own hand, a tome that is said to hold the secrets to His divinity. The enemy who hounds them is like no other, a force of ancient evil directed by a leader of impossible ambitions and incalculable cunning.<br><br>From crumbling tombs to splendorous churches, Erin and her two companions must confront a past that traces back thousands of years, to a time when ungodly beasts hunted the dark spaces of the world, to a moment in history when Christ made a miraculous offer, a pact of salvation for those who were damned for eternity.<br><br>Here is a novel that is explosive in its revelation of a secret history. Why do Catholic priests wear pectoral crosses? Why are they sworn to celibacy? Why do the monks hide their countenances under hoods? And why does Catholicism insist that the consecration of wine during Mass results in its transformation to Christ's own blood? The answers to all go back to a secret sect within the Vatican, one whispered as rumor but whose very existence was painted for all to see by Rembrandt himself, a shadowy order known simply as the Sanguines.<br><br>In the end, be warned: <i>some books should never be found, never opened--until now</i>.</p><p><p><b>Author One-on-One: James Rollins and Rebecca Cantrell</b></p> <p><strong>Q. How did you two meet?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I used to live in Hawaii, and Jim was my instructor at the Maui Writer&#x2019;s Retreat where I was workshopping a thriller. My first novel, A Trace of Smoke, had been accepted for publication a few weeks before and he kindly agreed to give me my first blurb. It was so good, I printed and hung it above my writing desk until it got covered in gecko poop. Then I took it down. Sorry about the poop, Jim.</p> <p><strong>Q. <em>The Blood Gospel</em> is a bit of a deviation from the books that both of you are traditionally known for. What inspired the idea for this book?</strong></p> <p><strong>James:</strong> This book came about from viewing Rembrandt&#x2019;s painting of "The Raising of Lazarus." It struck me strange how scared everyone looked, and this started me down a road of reflection about early Catholicism, vampirism, and a story began to unfold. I knew this could be a huge, ground-breaking new mythology, a story so epic in scope that I knew I didn&#x2019;t want to tackle this alone.</p> <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Jim called to ask me if I was interested in collaborating on a project. The premise and the world were so intriguing and controversial, I said yes immediately.</p> <p><strong>Q. Both of you are well known authors in your own right; how did you learn to collaborate?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> We went back and forth a lot while trying to decide what would be fun and interesting for both of us. Since we&#x2019;re two people, more ideas come out and the books end up going in a direction I don&#x2019;t think either of us would have found on our own. Luckily, he&#x2019;s very open and easy to work with and has never once said &#x201c;that&#x2019;s the stupidest idea ever,&#x201d; because I think you need to feel safe to throw out any idea at the beginning and see what sticks.</p> <p><strong>James:</strong> It&#x2019;s one of the best things about collaboration: we each bring a unique skill set to the table. Scenes where I know I perhaps am more deft (i.e. action), I handle. Likewise, Becky&#x2019;s skill at characterization and atmospheric historical descriptions, I let her run with it. That said, then we each take each other&#x2019;s work and tweak it in new and surprising ways that neither of us could have done alone.</p> <p><strong>Q. Could vampires have been or be real?</strong></p> <p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Our series plays with the idea that vampires are and always have been a myth, but the myth is based on some truth&#x2014;that strigoi have always existed within and without the Church and their bloody crimes have formed the basis of the vampire myth.</p> <p><strong>James:</strong> It was interesting how many of the Church&#x2019;s trappings (hooded robes, crosses, celibate priests, and the rite of turning wine into Christ&#x2019;s blood) could be directly folded into the vampire mythology. It makes you wonder if the Church isn&#x2019;t keeping something secret about a mythology that has existed for millennia.</p> <p><strong>Q. Can fans expect to find elements of science in this series?</strong></p> <p><strong>James:</strong> With a scientific background in biology, I wanted to instill into the mythology how vampirism might be possible, how such creatures could live among us, how they could survive without beating hearts, why silver would be toxic to them. The goal of this book was to explore the line between faith and science, so that meant exploring a scientific and historical rationalization for the existence of vampires.</p><b>About James Rollins</b><br><br>JAMES ROLLINS is a #1 New York Times bestselling author of international thrillers that have been translated into more than forty languages.

When Lasater learned that one of her students was collecting her thoughts&#x2014;which she called "Judith&#x2019;s aphorisms"&#x2014;Lasater decided to collect them in this book. Featuring one thought for each day of the year, along with a suggested practice, these brief, powerful insights reflect the author&#x2019;s knowledge of classic yoga philosophy and years of experience. Humorous, inspiring, and surprisingly down-to-earth, they guide seekers both on and off the yoga mat. These aphorisms address love, asana, fear, trust, expectations, pranayama, suffering, laughter, presence, the Yoga Sutra, and much more. They emphasize the experience of being present to one&#x2019;s self and to life&#x2019;s ups and downs&#x2014;day by day, breath by breath, moment by moment. <i>A Year of Living Your Yoga</i> is a gentle invitation to readers to know themselves on a deeper level.</p><p>Judith Lasater has taught yoga since 1971.

Walton Lillehei, who, along with colleagues at University Hospital in Minneapolis and a small band of pioneers elsewhere, accomplished what many experts considered to be an impossible feat: He opened the heart, repaired fatal defects, and made the miraculous routine.<br><br>Acclaimed author G. Wayne Miller draws on archival research and exclusive interviews with Lillehei and legendary pioneers such as Michael DeBakey and Christiaan Barnard, taking readers into the lives of these doctors and their patients as they progress toward their landmark achievement. In the tradition of works by Richard Rhodes and Tracy Kidder, <b>King of Hearts</b> tells the story of an important and gripping piece of forgotten science history.</p><p>The surgeon-as-rock-star mystique seems like it must have come straight out of Hollywood, but the myth had to begin more concretely. A good candidate is Minnesota's Dr. Walt Lillehei, the hard-working, hard-playing father of open-heart surgery, whose life is told in garish color in <i>King of Hearts</i> by journalist G. Wayne Miller. From his early brilliance, recovery from deadly lymphatic cancer, and dramatic repair of seemingly hopeless heart cases to the disintegration of his career at its peak thanks to an army of personal enemies and conviction on tax evasion counts, his story is consistently surprising and engaging. Fast cars, hard drinking, and plenty of women filled his time when he wasn't turning lives around with a few strokes of his scalpel, and the reader will find the surgeon's actions almost unbelievable--rarely endearing, but occasionally saintly. Combining this melodramatic biography with the fascinating story of the struggle for open-heart surgery, considered impossible little more than a generation ago, Miller makes a compelling case that the daring scientist was simply another side of the arrogant, absent-minded playboy. No ordinary biography, <i>King of Hearts</i> is breathless reading--you'll find yourself surfacing every few chapters to remind yourself its nonfiction. <i>--Rob Lightner</i>G.

But when the very last leaf falls to the ground, Fletcher feels as though he's let down his friend . . . </p><p> . . . until the first day of winter, when Fletcher sees that his tree has turned into a shining, glittering surprise.</p></p><p><p>Julia Rawlinson grew up in London and graduated from Southampton University with a degree in geography.

She lives in London with her husband and two sons. </p><i>Starred Review.</i> PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;This potent synthesis of art and prose conveys a child's first awareness of the changing seasons with reverence and wonder. Fletcher, a tiny fox, is concerned when his favorite tree turns brown. His mother tells him, Don't worry, it's only autumn, but the tree hardly seems fine to Fletcher. As its leaves fall and flutter away, the youngster struggles in vain to catch and reattach them. When only one leaf remains, he does his level best to secure it to the limb, but eventually the stem dries up and the leaf pops off. Mournful and confused, he carries it home and takes it to bed with him. Still worried about his tree, he wakes up the next morning to find that it has undergone a sweet and satisfying transformation. Beeke's resplendent watercolors work beautifully with the book's tone, content, layout, and design. Picture books about nature sometimes suffer from cloying, excessively pastoral language or imagery; this rare example succumbs to neither.

And, he writes, they are &#34;curious to a fault, want a working understanding of every aspect of their surroundings, and their memory is impeccable.&#34; His affectionate portrait may not convince English speakers to stop calling each other turkeys, but it will make welcome reading for birders and wildfowl enthusiasts.Joe Hutto is a nationally-recognized naturalist and wildlife artist.

These drives are your desires for more control, competence, congruence, caring, connection, change, challenge, creative expression, contribution, and consciousness. These drives shape everything you think, feel, and do in life, so understanding and mastering them is critical to your success and happiness. Strategically activating these drives on a consistent basis is the fastest path to living a fully charged life. <br> <br>Harnessing our human drives is not easy; if it were, we wouldn&#x2019;t see so much restlessness in the world. That&#x2019;s why Brendon has devised what he calls the true &#x201c;activators&#x201d; of human experience&#x2014;a series of powerful yet simple actions<i> </i>you can take to radically increase your levels of energy, engagement, and fulfillment in all areas of your life. <br> <br>What Brendon uncovers in <i>The Charge </i>will surprise and challenge you. It turns out that most of the ways we seek to meet our human drives are actually counterproductive. We all want more control, for example, but seeking to have more certainty in our daily lives or to control other people will actually decrease our levels of control (and happiness). We have a deep desire for change, too, but we often fail to make the right kinds of change that would make us feel more alive and in command of our lives. <br> <br>In <i>The Charge</i>, Brendon helps us overcome these mistakes and illuminates the path for strategically and intelligently activating our 10 human drives so that we can have the one thing we all want: more life in our lives!

It will directly call into question why you are allowing yourself to live at the energetic level where you currently reside, and it will aggressively challenge you to live a more vibrant, strategic, and engaged life.<br> <br>In the pages ahead you will find a pragmatic, often counterintuitive guide that cuts through the clutter of bad advice, lays waste to nearly half a century of psychological misunderstanding, and paves a shimmering golden path to one, and only one, destination: a new life that makes you feel truly, fully, magnificently <i>alive</i>.<br> <br>Face it: the emotional energy of the world has flatlined. Over the past forty years, across almost every developed country in the world, the diagnosis of clinical depression has grown nearly tenfold. This, despite the fact that almost every factor we associate with well-being&#x2014;plentiful food, money, education, safety, access to the arts and health care&#x2014;is abundant in these societies. Increasingly, people are reporting feelings of restlessness, fatigue, stress, and a sort of unnamable malaise that leaves them too often feeling bored, unsure, or frustrated.<br> <br>My guess is, you can relate. Like everyone else, you have everything they say you &#x201c;need&#x201d;&#x2014;safety, shelter, sustenance&#x2014;and yet there are too many days that you don&#x2019;t feel as excited, productive, or fulfilled as you thought you would. At some level, you may sense that you are not fulfilling the promises you&#x2019;ve made to yourself or expressing the potential that lives within you. You start each year fired up for the big race, only to finish at a slow trot. Your week is scheduled to the hilt, but deep down you can tell that the work keeping you busy isn&#x2019;t your life&#x2019;s work. You&#x2019;ve got the smarts and the soul and the hunger and the will, but all too often you find yourself spinning on a less-than-merry-go-round of doubt and delay. You&#x2019;re connected to everyone and everything online, but you don&#x2019;t feel nearly as connected to the world or to others as you would like. You&#x2019;re waiting for some kind of permission or right timing to live full out every single day. You feel a restless desire for something more.<br> <br>Well, I&#x2019;m here to tell you that you <i>deserve</i> something more. But there&#x2019;s a catch: to get it, you&#x2019;re going to have to demand more of yourself. Those words might discourage you or even stop you dead from reading on, I know. You&#x2019;re already fighting hard to stay afloat and awake, hammered by a tough economy, unreasonable demands from every quarter, and not enough sleep. Probably the last thing you want to hear is that you&#x2019;ve got to try harder, work smarter, or give more in life.<br> <br>The problem is, you do. And whether it makes me popular or not, I&#x2019;m going to challenge you in these pages&#x2014;and I hope you let me and then rise to the challenge, because I think you know there actually <i>is</i> more for you out there. I think you&#x2019;ve tasted plenty of magically happy, engaged, and satisfying moments in your life and are willing to do what it takes to enjoy more of them. You can remember times when you had more fun, when you were wild and carefree and felt more excited and hopeful than you ever imagined possible. In short, you&#x2019;ve already had a glimpse, a taste, of the Charged Life&#x2014;a heightened existence that makes you feel energized, engaged, and enthusiastic about living.<br> <br>If that&#x2019;s true, then let me show you my cards: I don&#x2019;t think the restlessness, boredom, anxiety, fear, or any other enduring negative emotion you may feel about yourself, others, or life in general has anything to do with the economy, the evermore chaotic world we live in, your childhood, bad luck, or any other easy excuse that the propagators of victimhood are handing out these days. No, any lack of charge in your life is only the result of a colossal failure in <i>strategy</i>. Only the failure to strategically control the contents of your consciousness keeps you from feeling the consistent internal charge of being fully alive, engaged, connected, and fulfilled. The good news is, you now hold in your hands a very strategic book.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m convinced that you&#x2019;ve felt a spark in life before, one that lit you up for days. But I don&#x2019;t want just to give you back an emotional charge you may have sensed once or twice before&#x2014;that would be the sort of cheap trick you could expect from a carnival hypnotist. I want to show you an entirely new plane of possibility and emotional vibrancy that you never knew existed. A more vital, more colorful, more exciting, sexier reality can be yours.<br> <br>To help people reach that kind of existence, I&#x2019;ve spent fifteen years intricately studying everything I could get my hands on in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, human potential, and high performance. I&#x2019;ve dedicated my life to the pursuit of helping others strategically, radically, and permanently increase their energy, their engagement, and their enthusiasm&#x2014;<i>their internal charge</i>&#x2014;in every area of life. I&#x2019;ve helped executives reinvigorate not just themselves but their entire companies, couples reignite their love lives, athletes get their mojo back, artists reconnect with their higher genius, parents revivify their relationships with their children, and celebrities and politicians reenergize their followerships, all by helping them tap into a stronger internal charge&#x2014;something they already had waiting within them. For this work, I&#x2019;ve become one of the best-paid high-performance coaches and trainers in the world, and my world-renowned seminar, High Performance Academy, sets the standard in the personal growth and effectiveness business. But here&#x2019;s the thing: this isn&#x2019;t about me, and it never has been. I don&#x2019;t do this by chest pounding or by hyping you up with affirmations. I do this by building a strategic plan that allows you&#x2014;no, that <i>challenges you&#x2014;</i>to live your best life.<br> Modern Motivations<p></p> <br>It&#x2019;s time we all got more strategic and purposeful in how we live our lives.<br> <br>Why is it that in our abundant world of choice and connectivity so many of us feel lacking and detached? With all the how-to information available at our fingertips, why are we so unsure of which levers to pull to dramatically improve our lives? How is it that we have so much&#x2014;a roof over our heads, opportunity, safety, choices, access to the entire world&#x2014;and yet don&#x2019;t feel sparked with energy <i>all the time</i> (or at least a lot more of the time)?<br> <br>In days gone by, self-help gurus and armchair psychologists would respond to these questions by suggesting that we&#x2019;re all crazy, ungrateful, or oblivious of all the good things being heaped upon us. They would say we are driven by dark needs that don&#x2019;t allow us to bask in the sunlight, that we are too trapped in the past, that we expect too much, that we are unconscious of our real thoughts and patterns, or that we are not sending out enough powerful thoughts to attract the happiness in life that we deserve. These answers, of course, are inadequate. In fact, they have caused more harm than good.<br> <br>So . . . back to the essential question: With so many of our basic human needs now being met, why don&#x2019;t we feel more electrified and satisfied with our lives?<br> <br>The answer introduces a controversial argument: We feel unsatisfied because the entire baseline of our human motivations has <i>evolved</i>. What made us feel happy, energized, and fulfilled just fifty years ago no longer applies, because our brains, bodies, and society have changed so radically.<br> <br>Such evolutionary language riles a lot of old-school biologists, who argue that the human brain and body could not have evolved fast enough in the past half-century to change our collective human motivations&#x2014;that as a species, we&#x2019;ve always been motivated by the same basic human needs. Even if that&#x2019;s true&#x2014;and many have argued otherwise&#x2014;what is clear is that in our abundant modern culture, the <i>way in which</i> we activate and feel satisfied by those needs has changed entirely.<br> <br>Consider this. In the most recent eyeblink of our history, our human experience and our collective culture have transformed in every imaginable way: in what we do (more creative and autonomous work now than task-driven, managed, repetitive work); how we get our food and what we eat (leading to an astonishing evolution in the size of our bodies worldwide); where we call home (the global migration into cities); how we interact (a recently interconnected planet working in offices and organizations rather than fields and factories); what we buy (more nonessential purchases based on aesthetic preferences rather than on functionality or utility); how we spend our time (more at work and yet still more in front of the television and computer); how long we live (longer, but with more health problems than ever&#x2014;many <i>because</i> we live longer); and how we structure our organizations and nations (more democracy and tolerance worldwide&#x2014;a trend closely tracked since 1981). If you could hopscotch back through history to fifty or a hundred years ago, you would see how much <i>everything</i> has changed. And having changed our world so completely, it was inevitable that we humans ourselves should also change in order to survive and thrive. The ways we think, feel, and behave&#x2014;our psychology&#x2014;had to keep pace with our world. Thus, the way we express and meet our human drives has evolved.<br> <br>As our society becomes more abundant, people are no longer driven by just what they <i>need</i>. Most of our basic human needs for food, shelter, safety, and belonging have been met and structured by an advancing society. Yet meeting those needs does not, by itself, make us happy. Far from it. Unfortunately, much of our basic understanding of pop psychology still comes from Abraham Maslow&#x2019;s famous &#x201c;hierarchy of needs&#x201d; developed in the 1940s. Maslow was brilliant, and much of his work was misinterpreted, but its lasting legacy is this: if we can meet our needs, we should be happy. So when we have our needs met and <i>don&#x2019;t</i> feel happy, we all feel that something is wrong with us.<br> <br>The reality is that in an abundant culture we simply no longer have to focus as much on what we need, so we focus on what we <i>want</i>. We have more options and, thus, more freedom to choose what we want our lives to be about. Surrounded by a million choices, we are freed from the constraints of need and yet, at the same time, challenged to find our focus and meaning in life. But no one would suggest that we turn back the clock. It&#x2019;s a blessing to be able to search for what we want. It just so happens that what we want today is very, very different from what we wanted just a decade ago.<br> <br>Think about how the tidal shift from needs to wants has washed ashore at work. Our modern workforce isn&#x2019;t driven by the mere security of a paycheck or the primitive motivation of the carrot-and-stick wielded by manipulative managements. Today&#x2019;s workers have a new and insatiable hunger for intrinsic motivations, especially the engagement and fulfillment that comes from projects involving creative control, social connectivity, design, story, and contributions that extend beyond the confines of the cubicle and the greater organization. We&#x2019;ve become an on-the-go, &#x201c;friended&#x201d; workforce that places social interaction, aesthetic experience, innovation, and meaningful collaboration at the top of our priority list when evaluating jobs, causes, projects, and leaders. The old concepts of motivation at work, based solely on compensation, a corner office, and long-term ladder-climbing ambitions, no longer apply (and haven&#x2019;t for a decade). We just aren&#x2019;t as fooled by all the usual trappings of success anymore, because in an already abundant society, <i>what drives us</i> has changed. Our modern lives simply don&#x2019;t function based solely on the same considerations of security and sustenance anymore, nor do we see our path to self-actualization the same way we saw it even a generation ago. With all the choice we have, we&#x2019;ll skip traditional security and instead seek novel, challenging, connected, and creative experiences. This isn&#x2019;t just the ramblings of a self-confessed modern free agent. Neuroscience is proving that indeed, when our brains are free from the basic animal needs of safety, what engages the most neural activity are those very things: <i>novelty</i>, <i>challenge</i>, <i>connection</i>, and <i>expression</i>. And many of the world&#x2019;s largest happiness surveys are finding the same at a global level&#x2014;we want to feel engaged at work, and what makes us engaged are things like choice, contribution, and creative expression.<br> <br>We have watched our professional and personal lives blend more and more, until the concept of work/life balance seems a nostalgic pipe dream from the 1950s. Today our home lives are more hectic, stressful, and unstable than they have ever been. People have trouble staying together or even getting along. Parents have a hard time understanding what drives their children&#x2019;s behavior, let alone their own. With the kids booked up doing after-school activities, and Mom and Dad at work all the time, what can families <i>really</i> hope to accomplish together? Putting a roof over your family&#x2019;s head, or food on the table, isn&#x2019;t enough anymore, no matter how much you might wish it were. In a hyperconnected and abundant world, your family members are supremely aware of the choices they have. Every day they see better houses, parents, schools, and toys and gadgets on television and the Web. So they care little that they have what they need&#x2014;that, for them, is a given. They care about having what they <i>want</i>.<br> <br>How can we think more strategically about ourselves and what motivates us today when meeting our basic human needs simply isn&#x2019;t moving the happiness needle out of the blah zone? What&#x2019;s going to lead us to exciting, fulfilling lives amid the sea change going on in our workplaces and our personal lives? How do we get that spark back into our lives, so that what we do fills us with joy and satisfaction? What levers can we pull on this grand ride of life so that we reach our full potential and travel in style to our destiny?<br> <br>In <i>The Charge</i>, I&#x2019;ll answer these questions by proposing a new framework for thinking about human motivation&#x2014;one that moves us away from merely doing what we need to do to feel secure and comfortable and into the drives that make us feel truly <i>alive</i>. Along the way, we&#x2019;ll go deep inside your mind and understand the structure of your brain, and we&#x2019;re going to give you the mental levers to actually <i>change</i> that wiring. The mixed bag of emotions that you feel about your life and your work is going to be laid bare before you, and, perhaps for the first time in your conscious adult life, you&#x2019;re going to learn how to control, reassemble, and reconfigure it so that you can experience the Charged Life.<br> <br><i>A Charged Life is a consciously designed existence that feels evenly engaged, energized, and enthusiastic.</i> It&#x2019;s a life that is purposefully chosen and activated by leveraging the 10 drives that make us human, which are the subject of this book. The Charged Life is not a one-time feeling or a fleeting spark. It&#x2019;s an enduring flame in the soul that illuminates you throughout all your days no matter the darkness around you. Nor is it about wandering around with a fake perma-grin or feeling supercaffeinated or amped up by some syrupy cocktail of self-help affirmations. It is about elevated yet consistently even energy that is strategically planned for and sustainable, allowing you to be fully engaged in the moment and optimistic about the future. I&#x2019;ll further describe this life in the next chapter, but for now you should underline the operative phrase in its d...</p><h2>Point of Origin: Scarpetta (Book 9)</h2><p><b>The clues to a series of remorseless killings go up in smoke&#x2014;and only Kay Scarpetta can find them in this #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestseller from Patricia Cornwell.<br><br>&#x201c;Sears its way into the psyche...Ablaze with Cornwell&#x2019;s finest, scariest writing.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Atlanta Journal Constitution<br><br></i></b>The devastating fire tore through the horse farm, destroying everything it touched.

And when Scarpetta learns that her old nemesis, Carrie Grethen, has escaped from a hospital for the criminally insane and is somehow involved, the investigation becomes personal. Tragedy strikes close to home. And Scarpetta must match Grethen&#x2019;s every move with one of her own to douse the inferno of evil that threatens everyone around her...<br><br><b>Includes an Introduction by the Author</b></p><p>When your everyday life is filled with death it's easy to find yourself a little edgy. The audio version of Patricia Cornwell's <i>Point of Origin</i> gives fans of her familiar heroine, Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a little something extra, a chance to hear the deep hurt and burning cynicism of the chief medical examiner's biting words. "You don't put your hands inside their ruined bodies and touch and measure their wounds.... You see clean case files and glossy photos and cold crime scenes. You spend more time with the killers than with those they ripped from life. And maybe you sleep better than I do, too. Maybe you still dream because you aren't afraid to."<p> Perhaps because Kate Reading has also narrated Cornwell's <i>Unnatural Exposure</i> and <i>Cause of Death</i>, her voice conveys experience and the history of what has come before, allowing listeners to hear between the lines. Using a subtle but effective range of vocal inflections, Reading lifts the characters off the page and carries them along as the plot spins ever faster, tangling Scarpetta in a snarl of arson, deceit, and psychopathic murder. With her arch nemesis making threats and suspicious fires leaving calcified corpses, Dr. Scarpetta's long-overdue romantic getaway has gone up in smoke. It's just one more day at the morgue, and <i>Point of Origin</i>, another hit in the popular series of Scarpetta mysteries, finds the good doctor's attitude honed razor sharp. (Running time: 11 hours, eight cassettes) <i>--George Laney</i></p><br>"[Kate] Reading's performance is outstanding as the first-person narrator . . .

The section on pollination, covered in detail in the illustrations, is very clear. A simple project--how to grow a bean plant--is included. A final page gives odd and unusual facts. Unfortunately, the text is pedestrian and occasionally awkward. The boldly colored illustrations are casual, somewhat careless, and some plants are hard to recognize. Other books cover the same subject with more excitement in language and zest in visual design. Bean and Plant (Silver Burdett, 1986) by Back, Reason for a Flower (Putnam, 1983) by Heller, or Lauber's Seeds: Pop, Stick, Glide (Crown, 1981) are better titles. --Sharon Levin, University of Vermont, Burlington<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Stained Glass Garden: Projects &amp; Patterns</h2><p><p>Grow a glass garden&#x2014;and beautify any space with the exquisite decorative items you&#x2019;ve created. George W. Shannon and Pat Torlen, two master teachers and artists who run the On The Edge Glass Studio, offer an array of glorious patterns for stained glass flowers, butterflies, birds, birdfeeders, planters, lanterns, and mobiles. Using dozens of close-up photos, they teach all the basics of both copper foil and lead came construction, from materials and tools to how-to techniques. </p><p><em>A Selection of the Crafters Choice Book Club.</em></p></p><p>How to best combine two passions--in this case, gardening and stained glass? In their fifth book, Shannon and Torlen team to produce 28 different projects, all worthy of emulation. Breezing through the fundamentals squeezed into, unfortunately, too few pages, Shannon and Torlen feature elegant nature-inspired designs in two waves: one for lead came, the other for copper foil. Regardless of the technique, each project includes dimensions, number of pieces, glass required, other materials and tools, step-by-step instructions, a ready-to-enlarge template, and notes and tips (for instance, never leave a burning candle unattended). Applications are varied, such as window and garden panels, jiggle stakes, lanterns, mobiles, bird feeders, torchieres, garden sprinklers, even a Zen garden. And nature is well represented, from a bee and butterflies to snowy egrets and spiderwebs. Too bad the layout is cramped and the photographs way too small. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

What elevates this version above all the others is the touching meditations at the beginning of each hour. For example, from the hour of Terce:O divine and adorable Lord, Jesus Christ, who has graciously redeemed us by thy bitter passion and death, we offer up this hour of Terce to thy honor and glory, and most humbly beseech thee through the torments thou didst endure in being cruelly scourged at a pillar, crowned with thorns, and unjustly condemned to be crucified, to grant us patience and longanimity under the scourges of temporal afflictions, courage to walk in the thorny road to the narrow gate, which opens to bliss, and perseverance under all the crosses of this life, which are the portion of the elect, that by suffering for our sins we may fully satisfy thy divine justice on earth, and may enter into thy glory immediately after death. Amen.Those who love Our Lady will appreciate that these short prayers allow them not only to sanctify the day but to do it using a text that is at reverent and readable; the language exemplifies noble simplicity and unembellished piety, in the most beautiful tradition of good liturgical prayer. It is appropriate both to those who attend the ordinary and extraordinary forms of Catholic Mass. This updated version restores the traditional ordering of the prayers and places it in a user-friendly format that eliminates flipping pages back and forth.</p><p></p><h2>Skippyjon Jones Shape Up</h2><p>Skippyjon has an overactive imagination.

Spader and I flumed to Veelox, but found the action wasn't there. It was here on First Earth.<br><br>Where is First Earth? The better question is, <i>when</i> is First Earth? I'm in New York City and it's 1937. March of 1937 to be exact. To be <i>really</i> exact, it's March 11 of 1937. I'm writing this on my birthday. Here's a weird thought: If I'm in 1937 and it's my birthday, did I still turn fifteen? Kind of freaky, no?<br><br>I'll begin this new journal by telling you I stumbled into the most bizarro, confusing, dangerous situation yet. But then again, haven't I said that before? Let me give you a little taste of what happened in only the first few minutes since I got here....<br><br>Spader and I were nearly killed. Three times. We were also robbed and witnessed a gruesome murder. Happy birthday to me! The way things are going, I know what I want for my fifteenth birthday...the chance to have a sixteenth.<br><br>When Spader and I flumed in from Veelox, I had no idea of what "First Earth" meant. Since I'm from Second Earth, I could only guess that First Earth was sometime in the Earth's past. But how far past? For all I knew we were fluming back to a time when quigs were dinosaurs and we'd be on the run from hungry, yellow-eyed raptors.<br><br>I was totally relieved to find that when we landed at the gate, it was the exact same rocky room that I had been through many times before. Yes, we had arrived at the gate off the subway tunnel in the Bronx, New York. Phew. At least there were no T-rexes or Neanderthals waiting for us. That was the good news.<br><br>Bad news was that we weren't alone. As soon as the flume dropped us off, I saw two guys standing there, facing us. They wore old-fashioned gray suits, like Clark Kent wears in the old <i>Superman</i> show on TV Land. Actually, a better analogy is that these guys were dressed like the <i>bad guys</i> from that old show, because that's what they were. Bad guys. <i>Very</i> bad guys. They wore wide-brimmed hats that were pulled down low and had white handkerchiefs around their noses and mouths like banditos. There's only one word to describe these dudes.<br><br>Gangsters.<br><br>Their eyes looked wide and scared. No big surprise. They had just seen Spader and me drop out of nowhere in an explosion of light and music. They seemed totally stunned, which was good because there was one other detail I haven't mentioned....<br><br>They were both holding machine guns that were aimed at the flume -- and at us.<br><br>"Down!" I yelled at Spader.<br><br>The two of us jumped to opposite sides of the flume just as the gangsters started shooting. I crouched in a ball, totally unprotected as the deadly clatter from their rapid-fire guns echoed off the rocky walls. I thought for sure I'd get hit, but after a few seconds the shooting stopped, and I was still intact. I was afraid to move and even more afraid to look over and see if Spader was okay. The sharp explosions fell off to a distant echo that bounced around the cavelike room. My ears were ringing and the chemical smell of gunpowder burned my nose. I figured this was what it must be like to be in a war.<br><br>"Get up!" one of the gangsters ordered. "Hands in the air!"<br><br>I cautiously looked over to Spader and saw that he was okay. We stood slowly and raised our hands. The gangsters held their guns on us. I didn't know why. It wasn't like we had weapons of our own. The second gangster kept glancing nervously between the two of us. He looked almost as scared as we were. Almost.<br><br>"Th-They from Mars?" he asked his buddy nervously.<br><br>Under less terrifying circumstances, I would have laughed. It must have looked like we had just landed from outer space. Not only did we flash in through a storm of light, we were still dressed in our bright blue swimskins from Cloral. For a second I thought about pulling a huge bluff and chanting: "Drop your weapons or we will vaporize you with our mind-heat," or something equally sci-fi, but I didn't get the chance.<br><br>"Don't matter," barked the other gangster. He was definitely the one in charge, but I could tell from his voice that he was a little shaky too.<br><br>"We done our job," he added.<br><br>"S-So what about th-them?" the nervous gangster asked.<br><br>The guy in charge looked us over. I could almost hear the wheels turning in his brain. He didn't exactly seem like a rocket scientist, so they must have been very small wheels. I wondered if they hurt when they turned.<br><br>"You!" the guy barked at me. "Gimme that ring!"<br><br>I couldn't believe it. He wanted my Traveler ring! This was serious. You guys know how badly I need that ring. It shows me where the flumes are, and it's the only way I can get my journals to you. Without this ring, I'm lost.<br><br>"It's not worth anything," I said in a feeble attempt to talk him out of it.<br><br>"Don't matter," the gangster snapped back at me. "All I want is proof to show you two are real."<br><br>"Then take us with you, mates!" said Spader, trying to be friendly. "We're all the proof you need, in the flesh!"<br><br>"Those ain't my orders," he snarled.<br><br>"Really? What <i>are</i> your orders?" I asked.<br><br>"Just hand over the ring," the boss commanded. He raised his machine gun to prove he meant business. What could I do? I took off my ring and tossed it to him. He caught it and jammed it into his pocket.<br><br>"Let's step outside, nice and easy," the guy said.<br><br>This was good. It meant they weren't going to gun us down right that moment. Maybe there was a way out of this after all. The nervous gangster threw the wooden door open, then both stepped aside and motioned with their weapons for us to go through. I looked at Spader. Spader shrugged. We had to play along. With our hands up, we both stepped out of the gate and into the dark subway tunnel.<br><br>Everything was familiar, so I made a sharp right, knowing it was the way to the abandoned subway station.<br><br>But the gangster had other things in mind. "No, you don't," he ordered. "Keep walking."<br><br>We had to walk straight ahead, away from the door. Three steps later we stepped over the rail of the subway track. This was beginning to look bad again.<br><br>"Stop! Turn around."<br><br>Oh yeah, this was bad. We were both now standing on the train tracks.<br><br>"You move, you die," said the first gangster.<br><br>Yeah, right. We move, we die. If a train comes along, we <i>don't</i> move, we die. Not a lot of wiggle room here.<br><br>"Where are we, Pendragon?" whispered Spader.<br><br>His answer came in the form of a far off whistle. We both looked to our right and saw the headlight of a subway train rounding the bend, headed our way, on our track.<br><br>"What is that thing?" asked Spader nervously. Being from a territory that was covered entirely with water, he had never seen anything like a train before.<br><br>"That," I said, trying not to let my voice show the fear that was tearing at my gut, "is a pretty big tum-tigger."<br><br>"Hobey," said Spader in awe. "We just got here and we've already lost."<br><br>We had been on First Earth for all of two minutes, and we were staring death right in the eye.<br><br>Welcome home, Bobby Pendragon.<br><br>That's a taste of how our adventure on First Earth began. I don't want to get too far ahead because there was a whole lot that happened between the time I finished my last journal, and when we landed here. But I wanted to explain to you how I lost my ring. This is serious because as I write this journal to you, Mark and Courtney, I'm not really sure if you're ever going to read it. If I don't get that ring back, I'll never be able to send this to you. The only thing I can do is keep writing, hang on to the journals, and hope that I get the ring back soon.<br><br>Now, let me rewind to where I finished my last journal and get you guys back up to speed.<br><br>I spent my last few days on the territory of Cloral in a haze. We'd defeated Saint Dane, but I didn't feel much like celebrating. That's because Uncle Press was gone, and I kept replaying his last moments over and over in my head. Saint Dane had escaped through a flume and Spader tried to chase him. But a storm of bullets came back at him. Uncle Press realized what was happening, knocked Spader out of the way...and took the bullets himself.<br><br>He died in my arms. It was the absolute worst moment of my life. The only thing that kept me from totally losing it was that just before he died, he promised me we'd be together again. I know this sounds pretty loopy, but I believe him. If being a Traveler has taught me anything, it's that nothing is impossible. My eyes have been opened to so many new worlds and levels of existence that the idea of hooking up with Uncle Press again doesn't seem all that far-fetched.<br><br>Of course, I have no clue how it might happen. That's because I've only scratched the surface of knowing all there is to know about being a Traveler. I wish there were an instruction manual I could buy through Amazon.com that would spell out all the rules and regulations. Unfortunately, it's not that easy. I've got to learn things as I go along. And now I've got to do it without Uncle Press.<br><br>Welcome to my life as a Traveler, phase two.<br><br>In those last days on Cloral, I knew what my next move had to be, but I was putting it off because, well, I was scared. Things were different now. I was alone. It was a whole new ballgame and I wasn't sure if I was good enough to play in it.<br><br>When Saint Dane flumed out of Cloral, he was headed for a territory called Veelox. I knew I had to follow him, but the idea of going after him alone was about as appealing as setting my hair on fire. All things being equal, I think I'd rather have set my hair on fire. So I made a decision that I hope I don't regret.<br><br>I asked Vo Spader to go with me.<br><br>Don't get me wrong, Spader is a great guy. He's the Traveler from Cloral, after all. He saved my life more than once; he's an incredible athlete; he's about as brave as can be; and most importantly, he's my friend. So why should I be worried about asking him to come with me?<br><br>It's because his total, blind hatred of Saint Dane is dangerous. Saint Dane caused the death of his father and for that, Spader wants revenge. Big time. Hey, I don't blame him. But there were a few times on Cloral where Spader got so completely wrapped up in Saint Dane-hating that he nearly got us all killed. Truth be told, Spader's anger toward Saint Dane is one of the reasons Uncle Press is dead.<br><br>Since then, Spader promised me he would control himself, and his anger. I can only hope that when we come face-to-face with the demon again, and I guarantee we will, Spader won't do anything stupid. These were some of the conflicted thoughts that were banging around inside my head as I finished my last journal.<br><br>"Hobey-ho, Pendragon," Spader said as he strode into my apartment the morning of our departure.<br><br>Spader had almond-shaped eyes that looked sort of Asian. They turned up slightly and made him look as if he were always smiling. The truth was, most of the time he <i>was</i> smiling...when he wasn't obsessing over Saint Dane, that is. His long black hair was still wet, which meant he had been in the water. Spader spent a lot of time in the water, playing traffic cop with the boats and barges that came and went from Grallion. He loved his job, and his life there. At least he loved it before he found out he was a Traveler. Things had changed a little since then.<br><br>"It's time," I said.<br><br>"For what?" was his quick response.<br><br>"Cloral is safe. Uncle Press is gone. And I'm as ready as I'll ever be to go after Saint Dane."<br><br>Spader gave me a devilish smile. "Now you're talking, mate! I've been waiting to hear those words for weeks! What if the trail's gone cold?"<br><br>"I don't think that's possible," I answered. "Uncle Press always said that time between territories isn't relative."<br><br>Spader frowned. "You lost me."<br><br>I had to laugh. This didn't make a whole lot of sense to me either, but I had to trust Uncle Press.<br><br>"Look at it this way," I explained. "Saint Dane flumed to Veelox a few weeks ago, but since then he may have spent five years there. Or a minute."<br><br>"Now I'm totally lost," Spader said in frustration.<br><br>"Bottom line is, we're not too late," I said. "It doesn't matter when we go after him, because the flume will put us where we need to be, <i>when</i> we need to be there."<br><br>"O-kay," said Spader tentatively. "I'll trust you on that."<br><br>I'd already said good-bye to our friends on Grallion, and I'd sent my last journal to you. I had explained the importance of journals to Spader and he had already started his own. The person he chose to send them to on Cloral for safekeeping was Wu Yenza. She was the chief aquaneer and Spader's boss. He couldn't have picked a better person.<br><br>I took a last look around my apartment. Then we went down to the docks, loaded our air globes and water sleds onto a skimmer boat, and left Grallion for the flume. Spader was the expert, so he drove. As we shot across the water I looked back at the giant, floating farm habitat of Grallion, wondering if I'd ever see it again. I liked Cloral. There were times when I actually had fun on that territory. It gave me hope that being a Traveler didn't mean I always had to live in a state of fear and confusion.<br><br>Now the question was, what lay ahead of us? Pretty much a state of fear and confusion. Great. Here we go again.<br><br>The trip to the flume was cake. We anchored the skimmer near the reef, popped on the air globes that allowed us to breathe underwater, triggered the water sleds, and quickly sank below the surface. We didn't run into any shark quigs either. I think that once Saint Dane is finished with a territory, the quigs no longer patrol the gates. Still, I wasn't taking any chances. As we sped through the water being pulled by the sleds, I kept glancing back to make sure nothing nasty was sneaking up on us to try and get a nibble.<br><br>I didn't relax until we shot under the shelf of rock that led to the gate. Following the glow from my ring, we quickly found the wide circle of light that led up and into the cavern that held the flume. Moments later we were standing together in the cavern, staring up at the dark flume tunnel that was cut into the rock wall high over our heads.<br><br>This was it. The last few seconds of calm.<br><br>Spader looked at me and smiled. "My heart's thumpin'."<br><br>So was mine. We were standing at the starting line and the gun was about to go off. Spader loved adventure. Me? I'd just as soon be home watching toons. Knowing Spader was nervous made me feel like I wasn't such a weenie after all.<br><br>He added, "We're in for another natty-do, aren't we, mate?"<br><br>"Yeah," I answered. "Pretty much."<br><br>"No use in wasting time here then," he said, sounding a lot braver than I felt. <br><br>"Yeah," I said. "We're on the wrong territory."<br><br>I stood straight, looked up to the dark hole of the flume, and shouted, <i>"Veelox!"</i><br><br>The tunnel sprang to life. Shafts of bright light shot from deep inside. The familiar jumble of musical notes could be heard faintly at first, but quickly grew louder. They were coming to get us.<br><br>Spader turned to me and smiled. "Hobey-ho, Pendragon."<br><br>"Hobey-ho, Spader," I answered. "Let's go get him."<br><br>A second later we were swept up by the light and sound and pulled into the flume.<br><br>Next stop...Veelox.<br><br>First Aladdin Paperbacks edition May 2003<br><br>Copyright � 2003 by D.

I am a hotel manager. In April 1994, when a wave of mass murder broke out in my country, I was able to hide 1, 268 people inside the hotel where I worked.</p><p>When the militia and the Army came with orders to kill my guests, I took them into my office, treated them like friends, offered them beer and cognac, and then persuaded them to neglect their task that day. And when they came back, I poured more drinks and kept telling them they should leave in peace once again. It went on like this for seventy-six days. I was not particularly eloquent in these conversations. They were no different from the words I would have used in saner times to order a shipment of pillow-cases, for example, or tell the shuttle van driver to pick up a guest at the airport. I still don&#x2019;t understand why those men in the militias didn&#x2019;t just put a bullet in my head and execute every last person in the rooms upstairs but they didn&#x2019;t. None of the refugees in my hotel were killed. Nobody was beaten. Nobody was taken away and made to disappear. People were being hacked to death with machetes all over Rwanda, but that five-story building became a refuge for anyone who could make it to our doors. The hotel could offer only an illusion of safety, but for whatever reason, the illusion prevailed and I survived to tell the story, along with those I sheltered. There was nothing particularly heroic about it. My only pride in the matter is that I stayed at my post and continued to do my job as manager when all other aspects of decent life vanished. I kept the Hotel Mille Collines open, even as the nation descended into chaos and eight hundred thousand people were butchered by their friends, neighbors, and countrymen.</p><p>It happened because of racial hatred. Most of the people hiding in my hotel were Tutsis, descendants of what had once been the ruling class of Rwanda. The people who wanted to kill them were mostly Hutus, who were traditionally farmers. The usual stereotype is that Tutsis are tall and thin with delicate noses, and Hutus are short and stocky with wider noses, but most people in Rwanda fit neither description. This divide is mostly artificial, a leftover from history, but people take it very seriously, and the two groups have been living uneasily alongside each other for more than five hundred years.</p><p>You might say the divide also lives inside me. I am the son of a Hutu farmer and his Tutsi wife. My family cared not the least bit about this when I was growing up, but since bloodlines are passed through the father in Rwanda, I am technically a Hutu. I married a Tutsi woman, whom I love with a fierce passion, and we had a child of mixed descent together. This type of blended family is typical in Rwanda, even with our long history of racial prejudice. Very often we can&#x2019;t tell each other apart just by looking at one another. But the difference between Hutu and Tutsi means everything in Rwanda. In the late spring and early summer of 1994 it meant the difference between life and death.</p><p>Between April 6, when the plane of President Juvenal Habyarimana was shot down with a missile, and July 4, when the Tutsi rebel army captured the capital of Kigali, approximately eight hundred thousand Rwandans were slaughtered. This is a number that cannot be grasped with the rational mind. It is like trying&#x2014;all at once&#x2014;to understand that the earth is surrounded by billions of balls of gas just like our sun across a vast blackness. You cannot understand the magnitude. Just try! Eight hundred thousand lives snuffed out in one hundred days. That&#x2019;s eight thousand lives a day. More than five lives per minute. Each one of those lives was like a little world in itself. Some person who laughed and cried and ate and thought and felt and hurt just like any other person, just like you and me. A mother&#x2019;s child, every one irreplaceable.</p><p>And the way they died ...I can&#x2019;t bear to think about it for long. Many went slowly from slash wounds, watching their own blood gather in pools in the dirt, perhaps looking at their own severed limbs, oftentimes with the screams of their parents or their children or their husbands in their ears. Their bodies were cast aside like garbage, left to rot in the sun, shoveled into mass graves with bulldozers when it was all over. It was not the largest genocide in the history of the world, but it was the fastest and most efficient.</p><p>At the end, the best you can say is that my hotel saved about four hours&#x2019; worth of people. Take four hours away from one hundred days and you have an idea of just how little I was able to accomplish against the grand design.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What did I have to work with? I had a five-story building. I had a cooler full of drinks. I had a small stack of cash in the safe. And I had a working telephone and I had my tongue. It wasn&#x2019;t much. Anybody with a gun or a machete could have taken these things away from me quite easily. My disappearance&#x2014;and that of my family&#x2014;would have barely been noticed in the torrents of blood coursing through Rwanda in those months. Our bodies would have joined the thousands in the east-running rivers floating toward Lake Victoria, their skins turning white with water rot.</p><p>I wonder today what exactly it was that allowed me to stop the killing clock for four hours.</p><p>There were a few things in my favor, but they do not explain everything. I was a Hutu because my father was Hutu, and this gave me a certain amount of protection against immediate execution. But it was not only Tutsis who were slaughtered in the genocide; it was also the thousands of moderate Hutus who were suspected of sympathizing with or even helping the Tutsi &#x201c;cockroaches.&#x201d; I was certainly one of these cockroach-lovers. Under the standards of mad extremism at work then I was a prime candidate for a beheading.</p><p>Another surface advantage: I had control of a luxury hotel, which was one of the few places during the genocide that had the image of being protected by soldiers. But the important word in that sentence is image. In the opening days of the slaughter, the United Nations had left four unarmed soldiers staying at the hotel as guests. This was a symbolic gesture. I was also able to bargain for the service of five Kigali policemen. But I knew these men were like a wall of tissue paper standing between us and a flash flood.</p><p>I remembered all too well what had happened at a place called Official Technical School in a suburb called Kicukiro, where nearly two thousand terrified refugees had gathered because there was a small detachment of United Nations soldiers staying there. The refugees thought&#x2014;and I don&#x2019;t blame them&#x2014;that the blue helmets of the UN would save them from the mobs and their machetes. But after all the foreign nationals at the school were put onto airplanes safely, the Belgians themselves left the country, leaving behind a huge crowd of refugees begging for protection, even begging to be shot in the head so they wouldn&#x2019;t have to face the machetes. The killing and dismemberment started just minutes later. It would have been better if the soldiers had never been there to offer the illusion of safety. Even the vaguest rumor of rescue had been fatal to those on the wrong side of the racial divide. They had clustered in one spot and made it easy for their executioners to find them. And I knew my hotel could become an abattoir just like that school.</p><p>Yet another of my advantages was a very strange one. I knew many of the architects of the genocide and had been friendly with them. It was, in a way, part of my job. I was the general manager of a hotel called the Diplomates, but I was eventually asked to take charge of a sister property, the nearby Hotel Mille Collines, where most of the events described in this book took place. The Mille Collines was the place in Kigali where the power classes of Rwanda came to meet Western businessmen and dignitaries. Before the killing started I had shared drinks with most of these men, served them complimentary plates of lobster, lit their cigarettes. I knew the names of their wives and their children. I had stored up a large bank of favors. I cashed them all in&#x2014;and then borrowed heavily&#x2014; during the genocide. My preexisting friendship with General Augustin Bizimungu in particular helped save the Mille Collines from being raided many times over. But alliances always shift, particularly in the chaos of war, and I knew my supply of liquor and favors would run dry in some crucial quarters. Before the hundred days were over a squad of soldiers was dispatched to kill me. I survived only after a desperate half hour during which I called in even more favors.</p><p>All these things helped me during the genocide. But they don&#x2019;t explain everything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let me tell you what I think was the most important thing of all.</p><p>I will never forget walking out of my house the first day of the killings. There were people in the streets who I had known for seven years, neighbors of mine who had come over to our place for our regular Sunday cookouts. These people were wearing military uniforms that had been handed out by the militia. They were holding machetes and were trying to get inside the houses of those they knew to be Tutsi, those who had Tutsi relatives, or those who refused to go along with the murders.</p><p>There was one man in particular whom I will call Peter, though that is not his real name. He was a truck driver, about thirty years old, with a young wife. The best word I can use to describe him is an American word: cool. Peter was just a cool guy; so nice to children, very gentle, kind of a kidder, but never mean with his humor. I saw him that morning wearing a military uniform and holding a machete dripping in blood. Watching this happen in my own neighborhood was like looking up at a blue summer sky and seeing it suddenly turning to purple. The entire world had gone mad around me.</p><p>What had caused this to happen? Very simple: words.</p><p>The parents of these people had been told over and over again that they were uglier and stupider than the Tutsis. They were told they would never be as physically attractive or as capable of running the affairs of the country. It was a poisonous stream of rhetoric designed to reinforce the power of the elite. When the Hutus came to power they spoke evil words of their own, fanning the old resentments, exciting the hysterical dark places in the heart.</p><p>The words put out by radio station announcers were a major cause of the violence. There were explicit exhortations for ordinary citizens to break into the homes of their neighbors and kill them where they stood. Those commands that weren&#x2019;t direct were phrased in code language that everybody understood: &#x201c;Cut the tall trees. Clean your neighborhood. Do your duty.&#x201d; The names and addresses of targets were read over the air. If a person was able to run away his position and direction of travel were broadcast and the crowd followed the chase over the radio like a sports event.</p><p>The avalanche of words celebrating racial supremacy and encouraging people to do their duty created an alternate reality in Rwanda for those three months. It was an atmosphere where the insane was made to seem normal and disagreement with the mob was fatal.</p><p>Rwanda was a failure on so many levels. It started as a failure of the European colonists who exploited trivial differences for the sake of a divide-and-rule strategy. It was the failure of Africa to get beyond its ethnic divisions and form true coalition governments. It was a failure of Western democracies to step in and avert the catastrophe when abundant evidence was available. It was a failure of the United States for not calling a genocide by its right name. It was the failure of the United Nations to live up to its commitments as a peacemaking body.</p><p>All of these come down to a failure of words. And this is what I want to tell you: Words are the most effective weapons of death in man&#x2019;s arsenal. But they can also be powerful tools of life. They may be the only ones.</p><p>Today I am convinced that the only thing that saved those 1,268 people in my hotel was words. Not the liquor, not money, not the UN. Just ordinary words directed against the darkness. They are so important. I used words in many ways during the genocide&#x2014;to plead, intimidate, coax, cajole, and negotiate. I was slippery and evasive when I needed to be. I acted friendly toward despicable people. I put cartons of champagne into their car trunks. I flattered them shamelessly. I said whatever I thought it would take to keep the people in my hotel from being killed. I had no cause to advance, no ideology to promote beyond that one simple goal. Those words were my connection to a saner world, to life as it ought to be lived.</p><p>I am not a politician or a poet. I built my career on words that are plain and ordinary and concerned with everyday details. I am nothing more or less than a hotel manager, trained to negotiate contracts and charged to give shelter to those who need it. My job did not change in the genocide, even though I was thrust into a sea of fire. I only spoke the words that seemed normal and sane to me. I did what I believed to be the ordinary things that an ordinary man would do. I said no to outrageous actions the way I thought that anybody would, and it still mystifies me that so many ot...</p></p><h2>Superiority Burger Cookbook: The Vegetarian Hamburger Is Now Delicious</h2><p><p><strong>Winner of the 2019 Art of Eating Prize<br><br> With more than 90 mouth-watering recipes, <em>Superiority Burger Cookbook</em> lays bare the secrets of America&#x2019;s most talked-about vegetarian restaurant, in recipes as a simple as they are irresistible.</strong></p><p>Along with recipes for a coterie of other delights&#x2015;fresh, vegetarian, accidentally vegan, and always incredible&#x2015;you&#x2019;ll find out why Superiority Burger in New York City&#x2019;s East Village is the hottest ticket in North America and the surrounding continents.</p><p>Superiority Burger is a cozy counter hangout filled with affordable, innovative food that is a protest against the idea that extraordinary fare is the exclusive domain of the elite.

The action of Bailey&#39;s solid second McMurtrie and Drake legal thriller (after 2014&#39;s The Professor) begins in 1966, when five-year-old Bocephus Haynes sees his father lynched by a KKK mob. At 18, Bo leaves Pulaski, bound for university and eventually law school. He later returns to town with one goal: to make Andy Walton, former grand master of the local KKK, pay for his crimes. In 2011, Walton is found set ablaze and hanging from the tree on which Bo&#39;s father was hanged, and it doesn&#39;t take the local authorities long to arrest Bo. Devastating evidence keeps stacking up against him; only his lawyers, retired law professor Tom McMurtrie and Tom&#39;s law partner Rick Drake, believe that their client is being framed.

Alternative estimation techniques are first introduced using both the potential outcome model and causal graphs; after which, conditioning techniques, such as matching and regression, are presented from a potential outcomes perspective. For research scenarios in which important determinants of causal exposure are unobserved, alternative techniques, such as instrumental variable estimators, longitudinal methods, and estimation via causal mechanisms, are then presented. The importance of causal effect heterogeneity is stressed throughout the book, and the need for deep causal explanation via mechanisms is discussed.</p><p>Cause-and-effect questions are the motivation for most research in the social, demographic, and health sciences, even though definitive answers to cause-and-effect questions may not always be possible given the constraints that researchers face in collecting data and evaluating alternative explanations. The counterfactual approach to causal analysis represents a unified framework for the prosecution of these questions. This second edition of Counterfactuals and Causal Inference aims to convince more social scientists to take a counterfactual approach when analyzing the core empirical questions of the social sciences as well as applied research questions of public importance.Stephen L.

You&#x2019;d get no special treatment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t mean I&#x2019;d kill the guy, just shoot him a little.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then you&#x2019;d spend less time in jail. With good behavior you&#x2019;d be out in seven to ten.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I still have a badge.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Take a close look at your solid-gold, honorary-detective-first-class badge that was given to you by our former commissioner, now mayor. It&#x2019;s not engraved with the words &#x2018;Authorized to shoot anybody who annoys him.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not even double-parkers who block my garage door?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Especially not them.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone&#x2019;s cell phone rang and he looked at the number. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Joan,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;She never calls at this time of night. I&#x2019;d better get it. Hello?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Joan.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I know, I have caller ID.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve made a tiny little mistake,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; Stone moaned. He covered the phone. &#x201c;Joan says she&#x2019;s made a tiny little mistake,&#x201d; he said to his companions. &#x201c;That means she&#x2019;s made a real whopper of a mistake.&#x201d; He went back to the phone. &#x201c;All right, let me have it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s good news and bad news,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The good news is that I forgot to put a board meeting of the Arrington Group on your calendar.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone was immediately suspicious. &#x201c;And what is the bad news?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The meeting is tomorrow,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;At noon.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, I can probably get out of bed early enough to make that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not all the bad news.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; Stone said, mostly to himself.</p><p>&#x201c;You already said that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s the rest of the bad news?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The board meeting is in Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome is up the Hudson somewhere, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not that Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Rome, Georgia? Rome has an airport. I could fly myself down there tomorrow morning.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Think farther east.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, God,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Not <i>that </i>Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That one. Now don&#x2019;t say, &#x2018;Oh, God&#x2019; again, and don&#x2019;t panic&#x2014;there&#x2019;s an Alitalia flight tonight.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What time?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In, let&#x2019;s see, fifty-four minutes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Which airport?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;JFK.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a forty-five-minute drive,&#x201d; he pointed out.</p><p>&#x201c;And Fred is off tonight, he went to the theater.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never make it,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Think about this: you&#x2019;re sitting next to the guy with the fastest car in town.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hang on a minute.&#x201d; He turned to Dino. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to be at JFK in fifty-four minutes to catch a plane to Rome. Can I borrow your car?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You mean the one with the flashing lights on top?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the one.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can see the headlines in tomorrow&#x2019;s <i>Post</i>,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;POLICE COMMISH LOANS OFFICIAL CAR TO SCHMUCK, WHO IS INVOLVED IN TERRIBLE ACCIDENT.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Fifty-three minutes!&#x201d; Joan shouted from the other end of the phone call.</p><p>&#x201c;Only if I&#x2019;m in the car with you,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;That would shorten the headline to, SCHMUCK HITCHES RIDE WITH COMMISH.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You two better get going,&#x201d; Viv said.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not coming with us?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d scream all the way,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Go on, get your asses in gear! I&#x2019;ll get the check.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll call you en route with further instructions,&#x201d; he said to Joan, then hung up and ran for the door, followed closely by Dino.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2</p><p>Dino got into the backseat of the black SUV with Stone and slammed the door. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got fifty-one minutes to make a flight at JFK,&#x201d; he said to his driver. &#x201c;Punch it, and use the siren and the lights.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;God bless you,&#x201d; Stone said, patting him on the knee.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t bring God into this, and don&#x2019;t put your hand on my knee.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want me to shoot him, boss?&#x201d; the detective in the front passenger seat asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not unless he does it again. You get on the horn to security at Kennedy and tell them I want to drive onto the ramp. Find out what gate the Alitalia flight to Rome is occupying, and tell them to stand by for an arriving passenger, Barrington.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, sir.&#x201d; The detective whipped out his phone.</p><p>Stone dialed Joan&#x2019;s number.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Am I on the flight?&#x201d; he shouted over the siren.</p><p>&#x201c;You are&#x2014;you got the last seat, and I ordered you a car.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Good. I need a room at the Hassler in Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve already called them and talked to the night man. It&#x2019;s the middle of the night there, but he&#x2019;s promised to have you a bed, he just can&#x2019;t promise you a suite.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the board meeting tomorrow?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In a conference room at the Hassler.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When did we get notice of the meeting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you really need to know?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, I do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe ten days ago. I got busy and&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, go upstairs to my dressing room and pack the following, ready?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shoot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Use the two medium-sized cases. Pack a blue suit, a chalk-stripe, and&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know, maybe a tuxedo, pleated shirt, and black tie. Pack the black alligator oxfords, six pairs of boxers, six pairs of black socks, half a dozen linen handkerchiefs, and six shirts that go with the suits and half a dozen ties, and include my travel toiletries kit. Oh, shit, I don&#x2019;t have my passport. Find it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you wearing your blue blazer with the yacht club buttons?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Try the left inside pocket.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone slapped his chest, rummaged in the pocket, and came up with the alligator passport case. &#x201c;Got it. How did you know where it was?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;When the new one came in the mail, I saw you put it there. What else do you need?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A briefcase&#x2014;the black alligator one, and all the stuff that&#x2019;s in it. You might make sure there&#x2019;s a legal pad in there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Right. What else?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is it cold in Rome?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s spring, and Rome is a subtropical climate.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No coat, then. What&#x2019;s the agenda for the board meeting?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fax it to you before I go to bed.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;FedEx the luggage, so it&#x2019;ll be there the day after tomorrow. I&#x2019;ll make do until then.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Have a good trip.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Bye.&#x201d; Stone hung up and looked around. They were on what looked like the Van Wyck Expressway, and cars were scattering before them. &#x201c;I like this,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;This is how to go to the airport.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re lucky it isn&#x2019;t rush hour,&#x201d; the driver said.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s lucky he knows me,&#x201d; Dino said.</p><p>&#x201c;I know you, and I love you, Dino.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Stop that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is his hand on your knee again, boss?&#x201d; the detective asked.</p><p>&#x201c;He knows better than that now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Shucks, I was counting on shooting him.&#x201d;</p><p>They were off the expressway and onto the labyrinth of roads around the airport. They stopped at a gate, which rolled back to admit them, and a security guard gave them the gate number and directions.</p><p>&#x201c;You can turn off the siren now,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;But keep the lights on.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Gotcha, boss.&#x201d; The driver floored it, and two minutes later they pulled up next to a giant airplane, connected to the terminal by a snaking boarding tunnel.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks, Dino,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I owe you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll send you a bill. Now get your ass on the plane&#x2014;it was supposed to push back three minutes ago.&#x201d;</p><p>A security guard waved Stone to a door, and he ran up a flight of stairs, emerging in the tunnel near the aircraft door. A flight attendant awaited, his hand on the door. &#x201c;Any luggage, Mr. Barrington?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;None,&#x201d; Stone said, entering the airplane.</p><p>&#x201c;Just a moment.&#x201d; He closed the door behind them, turned right, and started down an aisle. They were in the tourist cabin, and the attendant was pointing at a seat right in the middle of the airplane.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait a minute&#x2014;no first class?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;The flight is full. This is it.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone sighed and squeezed past the knees of two very large passengers and flopped into the seat. An extremely fat man sat to his left, taking up the entire armrest. &#x201c;Welcome aboard,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Stone looked to his right and found a woman of reasonable proportions.</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you the lucky guy?&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Not lucky enough,&#x201d; Stone said, trying to find something to do with his left arm. &#x201c;How long is this flight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For me, nine hours. For you, forever.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Too right.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Hedy Kiesler,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Actually Hedwig Eva Maria Kiesler, but only my mother calls me that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;All of it?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Just Hedwig. If you call me anything but Hedy, I&#x2019;ll hurt you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe you,&#x201d; Stone said, offering a hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m Stone Barrington.&#x201d;</p><p>She leaned in. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you made it. I thought I was going to have to deal with the fat guy.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I heard that!&#x201d; the fat guy said.</p><p>&#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;</p><p>The airplane was moving backward; after a moment an engine started. A female flight attendant appeared. &#x201c;Mr. Barrington? I have two seats for you and your companion in first class.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What companion?&#x201d; Hedy asked Stone.</p><p>&#x201c;I think she means you. Join me?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You bet your sweet ass,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>The two of them struggled past the two fat men. &#x201c;Good riddance,&#x201d; one of them said. &#x201c;Move over one, George.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone, followed by Hedy, walked up the aisle and was shown to the first pair of seats at the front of the cabin. &#x201c;You can have the window,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry we couldn&#x2019;t seat you sooner,&#x201d; the attendant said, &#x201c;but the seats were booked by someone else who didn&#x2019;t show. I had to wait until we closed the door and pushed back before giving them to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Hedy eased into her seat. &#x201c;God, what a relief,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Do you always fly like this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, usually I fly myself in a light jet.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why not tonight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had to leave on short notice for a board meeting tomorrow in Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What kind of board?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;A hotel group. What takes you to Rome?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a painter. I&#x2019;ve taken an apartment for a month, and I&#x2019;m going to paint Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see any canvases or paints.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I shipped all that ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s your apartment?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;In the Pantheon district.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Where are you staying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;At the Hassler Villa Medici.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Very </i>nice.&#x201d;</p><p>The airplane rolled onto the runway and accelerated. Shortly, the attendant brought them dinner menus.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starved,&#x201d; Hedy said, opening the menu. &#x201c;How about you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I had a first course before my secretary called and told me I had to go to Rome.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No luggage?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not even a briefcase. I was lucky my passport was in my jacket pocket. Can I buy you a drink?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Several,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m terrified of flying.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t look terrified.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;re a calming influence,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I know bourbon is.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone ordered two double bourbons.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3</p><p>The cabin lights came on, and a voice blared over the loudspeakers, first in Italian, then: &#x201c;Ladies and gentlemen, we will land in Rome in approximately one hour. Breakfast will now be served.&#x201d;</p><p>Stone realized there was a head on his shoulder. She made a noise and sat up. &#x201c;Did she say breakfast?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We ordered it last night, don&#x2019;t you remember?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I remember only bourbon, but I don&#x2019;t remember how many.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t ask.&#x201d;</p><p>A flight attendant set omelets before them and they ate hungrily.</p><p>&#x201c;How do you feel?&#x201d; Stone asked when their plates had been taken away.</p><p>&#x201c;Nearly human.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>They deplaned and walked toward baggage claim. She was pulling a carry-on.</p><p>&#x201c;Do you have any checked luggage?&#x201d; Stone asked.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I sent it with the painting stuff.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Smart. Can I give you a lift into the city?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;</p><p>They walked through customs without incident, and Stone saw a man holding a sign with his name on it. A couple of minutes later they were in a large Mercedes sedan.</p><p>&#x201c;You travel well,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;What do you do?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an attorney.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What firm?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Woodman &amp; Weld.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;They represent my stepfather,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s your stepfather?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;His name is Arthur Steele.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m his lawyer. I represent the Steele insurance group.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe this is where I say, &#x2018;Small world.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Not yet&#x2014;my mother was a painter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What was her name?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Matilda Stone. Now you can say it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Small world.

He then discusses the ways that exceptionalism changed during America&#x2019;s evolution over the course of the 20th century. Which changes are gains to be applauded? Which are losses to be mourned? Answering these questions is the essential first step in discovering what you want for America&#x2019;s future.</p><p>Charles Murray is the W. H. Brady Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. He first came to national attention in 1984 with Losing Ground. His subsequent books include In Pursuit, The Bell Curve (with Richard J. Herrnstein), What It Means to Be a Libertarian, Human Accomplishment, In Our Hands, Real Education, and Coming Apart. He received a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in history from Harvard and a Ph.D. in political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

She also gave us <em>Come, Tell Me How You Live</em>, a charming, fascinating, and wonderfully witty nonfiction account of her days on an archaeological dig in Syria with her husband, renowned archeologist Max Mallowan. Something completely different from arguably the best-selling author of all time, <em>Come, Tell Me How You Live</em> is an evocative journey to the fascinating Middle East of the 1930s that is sure to delight Dame Agatha&#x2019;s millions of fans, as well as aficionados of Elizabeth Peters&#x2019;s Amelia Peabody mysteries and eager armchair travelers everywhere.<br></p><p>Agatha Christie was already a celebrated writer of mysteries when, in 1930, she married the archaeologist Max Mallowan. In the pre&#x2013;war years thereafter, Christie enthusiastically joined her husband on various archaeological expeditions in the Middle East, and these shared adventures, these happy and memorable times, provided her not only with the background for several of her novels, but also with the &#x201c;everyday doings and happenings&#x201d; which she zestfully describes in the pages of this high&#x2013;spirited memoir, which was first published in 1946. New Introduction by David Pryce-Jones.<p>To the world she was Agatha Christie, author of numerous bestselling mysteries and whodunits, arguably the most popular writer in the English language. But in the 1930s she wore a different hat, traveling with her husband, renowned archaeologist Max Mallowan, as he investigated the buried ruins and ancient wonders of Syria and Iraq. Described by the author as a "meandering chronicle of life on an archaeological dig," <em>Come, Tell Me How You Live</em> is Dame Agatha Christie's first-person account of her time spent in this breathtaking corner of the globe where recorded human history began. It is a fascinating, eye-opening, vibrant, and vivid portrait of a place, a people, and a past, by a legendary writer whose extraordinary popularity endures to this day; an altogether remarkable narrative of everyday life in a world now long since vanished.</p></p><h2>A Is for Annabelle: A Doll&#39;s Alphabet</h2><p>Learn the alphabet from A to Z with the help of Annabelle the doll.

The most diverse along the 96-mile LSHT, the beautiful forests are filled with nearly every species of tree that can be found in the bottomland and upland forests of East Texas. Double Lake is spring fed, making it unusually clear and cool for a small lake in this region. The lake feeds one of the major tributaries of Big Creek, which grows increasingly larger and more scenic as it runs toward the 1,420-acre Big Creek Scenic Area. In fact, numerous perennial streams and creeks feed into this protected area, resulting in a lush pine-hardwood forest filled with a variety of flora and fauna. Bird-watchers are particularly enamored with the Big Creek Section. </p><p>The LSHT itself remains well marked, including a newly rerouted section that moves the trail away from the erosion-prone banks of upper Big Creek. The hike covers rolling ground up along the banks of the creek and down into its bottomlands. There are a few muddy areas, but several are conveniently traversed by boardwalks. Every creek in this section is crossed by a hiker bridge, so there is no worry about having to ford them in rainy weather. </p><p>Camping is prohibited within the boundaries of the Big Creek Scenic Area. To reduce impact in this beautiful section, plan to camp in either the developed Double Lake Recreation Area at mile 75 (fee required) or the semideveloped backcountry site (no fee) simply named LSHT Primitive Campsite #1 at mile 75.7. Four small loop trails connect to the LSHT within the boundaries of the Big Creek Scenic Area, making this an excellent section for dayhiking. </p><p><b>Trail Access and Parking</b> </p><p>To reach Double Lake Recreation Area, take Highway 150 from Evergreen 5.7 miles east to Farm to Market (FM) 2025 (or 25 miles east from New Waverly). Turn right (south) onto FM 2025 for 0.4 mile and turn left onto Double Lake Park Road. Ask camp hosts about parking a car within the recreation area; there is a $6 fee per day to park here. Potable tap water is available at the campground. </p><p>To reach the Big Creek Scenic Area and LSHT Trailhead Parking Lot #12 (near LSHT mile 79.9) from the town of Shepherd along U.S. Highway 59, head west on Highway 150 for about 5 miles. Forest Service (FS) Road 217 is a small paved road that comes in from the left. Turn left (southeast) on FS 217 and follow it for 1.8 miles. The gravel LSHT Trailhead Parking Lot #12 will be on the right. A short side trail leads to the LSHT from the parking lot. Nonpotable water can be found in Big Creek just a short walk westbound on the LSHT. </p><p>To reach the eastern end of Section 9 (at LSHT mile 82.3) at the LSHT Trailhead Parking Lot #13 along Farm to Market (FM) 2666, from the town of Shepherd along U.S. Highway 59 head west on Highway 150 for about 1.5 miles. FM 2666 meets Highway 150 on the left. Turn left onto FM 2666 and follow it for 6.5 miles. LSHT Trailhead Parking Lot #13 is signed and visible on the right side of FM 2666. There is ample parking, a trash can, and bulletin board, but no drinking water. </p><p><b>Supplies and Accommodations</b> </p><p>Double Lake Recreation Area offers campsites ($16 per night) equipped with picnic tables, campfire rings, and cooking grills. Hot showers, bathrooms with running water, and potable water taps are located throughout the campground, as are vending machines and pay phones. In the warmer months on weekends, a concession stand may be set up in the park. These facilities are a few minutes&#x2019; walk from the LSHT. From mile 75 and the large LSHT sign by the southwest corner of the lake, turn left and head into the campground, which is visible from this spot (the LSHT continues to the right). </p><p>The town of Coldspring is about 4 miles from Double Lake, northeast on Highway 150. Coldspring (population: 691) does not offer any overnight lodging but does offer a local diner, barbeque restaurant, post office, dollar store, gas stations, and a large grocery store. The larger, full-service town of Shepherd (population: 2,262) along U.S. Highway 59 is 11 miles southeast of Coldspring and offers several motels. </p><p>Shepherd can also be accessed from the eastern, or southern, end of Section 9. From FM 2666 and LSHT Trailhead Parking Lot #13, follow FM 2666 about 6.5 miles east. Turn right (east) on Highway 150 and follow it 1.5 miles into Shepherd. From LSHT Trailhead Parking Lot #12 in the Big Creek Scenic Area, follow FS 217 northeast a few miles to intersect Highway 150. Shepherd is about 5 miles to the east. </p><p><b>Water</b> </p><p>The Big Creek Section is blessed with abundant water. At the shoreline of spring-fed Double Lake, it is a short walk off-trail to its developed recreation facilities (where potable tap water is available) at the western end of this LSHT section at mile 75. As the hiker heads into the middle region of this section, the trail parallels Double Lake Branch and, later, Big Creek. These spring-fed creeks flow year-round with clear water that is easily the most appealing of any groundwater along the entire LSHT. Only toward the eastern end of Section 9, from mile 79.8 to mile 82.3, is water scarce. </p><p><b>Trail Description</b> </p><p>The LSHT intersects Double Lake on the shoreline at the far southwest corner of the lake by a large LSHT sign at mile 75.0. The LSHT skirts but does not enter Double Lake Recreation Area&#x2019;s facilities. The trail continues eastbound from the large LSHT sign at mile 75; while facing the lake at the sign, make a hard right turn back into the woods to enter Section 9. Do not continue straight ahead on the trail across the lake&#x2019;s dam. (Remember that if you are westbound, you need to reverse all directions, left and right, in these trail descriptions.) </p><p>You soon cross a utilities right-of-way and intersect one of the recreation area&#x2019;s mountain biking trails. At mile 75.3, meet up with a short boardwalk over a wet section. Cross an old fence line and reach another short boardwalk. Notice a transition into picturesque moist woodland dominated by evergreen shrubs, vines, and ferns. Cross gravel Forest Service (FS) Road 220 and proceed through a hiker gate across the road and over a large creek that drains Double Lake at mile 75.6. This is a main tributary of Big Creek named Double Lake Branch, which you follow for the next 4 miles (though mostly at a distance). Cross a tiny bridge over a seasonal drainage and reach LSHT Primitive Campsite #1 at mile 75.7, which has four tent pads. Water is available back at the road in the creek that drains the lake....</p></p><h2>Concepts and Case Analysis in the Law of Contracts, 7th (Concepts and Insights)</h2><p>Recommended in more than 100 schools, the updated seventh edition of Concepts and Case Analysis in the Law of Contracts is a readable primer that offers first-year law students a reliable overview of the major themes and leading cases in the field of the law of contracts.

Brooks introduced Freddy the Pig in Freddy Goes to Florida. Freddy and his friends from Bean Farm migrate south for the winter, with every mile of the way a terrific adventure complete with bumbling robbers and a nasty bunch of alligators. This is vintage Freddy and the whole ensemble cast at their charming best.</p><p>Birds migrate south for the winter--why shouldn't farm animals? In Walter R. Brooks's <i>Freddy Goes to Florida</i>, that's precisely what the thoughtful beasts of Mr. Bean's upstate New York farm decide to do. Not wanting to leave the imperfect yet kindhearted farm owner in the lurch, they draw straws to select the lucky travelers. A robin draws them a map that shows them how to get to Florida, and they're off! The parade of animals--Jinx the cat, Freddy the pig, Robert the dog, Hank and Mrs. Wiggins the cows, Mr. and Mrs. Webb the spiders, two ducks named Alice, and four mice--causes quite a stir on the cross-country trek. In Washington, D.C., they even meet the president, who "shook them each by the claw or a paw or a hoof." After a series of humorous and suspenseful near misses, including a battle of wits with some Florida alligators, they end up safely back home, where Freddy poetically concludes, "And however they wander, both pigs and men / Are always glad to get home again." Brooks is hilariously tongue-in-cheek; his insightful descriptions of animal characters are always compassionate; and his subtle appeal to a child's instinct for justice is no less than masterful. As Adam Hochschild of the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> writes, "The moral center of my childhood universe, the place where good and evil, friendship and treachery, honesty and humbug were defined most clearly, was not church, not school, and not the Boy Scouts. It was the Bean Farm." <p> From 1927 to 1958 Brooks wrote 26 Freddy books--including <i>Freddy the Detective</i>--all focused on the well-rounded pig, who has been described by various fans as ingenious, intelligent, loyal, and resourceful. Since Brooks's books fell out of print, librarians across the country have scrounged up copies wherever possible, even resorting to photocopying the books and binding them with hockey-stick tape. Finally, to the delight of thousands, the fabulous Freddy books have been reprinted by Overlook Press. Welcome back, Freddy!

Geese soar in from the south, only to stand flat-footed on frozen lakes, complaining loudly to one another. Bears, groggy and cross, emerge to a world still cloaked in snow. Deer search in vain for tender shoots. Yet the wolf pups pushing their way into the world found their den warm and dry and welcoming. <br><br>Their silver mother greeted them, one by one, drying wet fur with her tongue and massaging breath into each tiny body. And though their eyes were sealed, their ears folded tightly against their heads, she could guess already what place each would take in the pack. <br><br>"Leader" she named the first brown pup, a vigorous male. The second, a female, she called "Sniffer." And she gave Sniffer's twitching nose an extra lick. Another female arrived, with spindly legs already in motion. "Runner," Silver said. "You will be swift and sure-footed, and the pack will need you." Then she drew the pup toward her nurturing body. The fourth emerged with his brow furrowed. "Thinker," his mother said fondly, licking his forehead smooth. "You will always be watching and planning, won't you?"<br><br>The den, dug into a hill above a frozen lake, angled downward from the entrance for six feet, then made a ninety-degree turn and rose for another six feet to the birthing room. The pups' father, King, a large black wolf with a white star on his chest, had been lying at the turn of the narrow tunnel, listening, waiting. As each pup emerged, his tail wagged fiercely. When the fourth pup had settled at the mother's side, King backed rapidly toward the surface.<br><br>"Four pups," he told the others waiting there. "Four healthy pups. Each one of them big and strong!" Then he danced, leaping and whirling for the joy of the new life that had come to the pack. <br><br>Helper, a young tan male born to these same parents the year before, danced, too. His silver sister, Hunter, joined them. "How fine to have pups!" they sang. How fine, too, no longer to be the youngest, the least in the pack!<br><br>Bider, a mature male, pure white, came forward. "What good news, King," he said, lowering his body and reaching up to nudge his leader's chin. <br><br>A few moments later, however, when King and the two yearlings lifted their heads to sing the new pups' praise, Bider looked on in silence. Once he, too, had been king. He'd had his own pack, his own pups to sing for. But that was before he had been deposed and driven out to hunt alone in the darkest part of winter. Now he waited, biding his time . . . and another king's pups were not what he was waiting for. He turned from the celebration. <br><br>The howl finished, King crawled once more into the den to check on his new family. Leader, Sniffer, Runner, Thinker. What splendid pups! <br><br>This time, though, he stopped, puzzled, halfway between the entrance and the birthing room. What was that new smell? He strained to see in the deep dark of the den. The eyes of a wolf gather in even the faintest rays of light, so he could just make out the four brown furry bundles lined up along their mother's belly. They were nursing vigorously, intent on their first meal. King's tail went into motion at the very sight of them. <br><br>But Silver was busy with something more. A pup? Was she washing another pup? Yes. This one black like his father, black with a minute white star on his chest. <br><br>King's own chest swelled at the sight, and he inched forward eagerly. A look-alike son! What name would his mate choose for this son who wore his black fur and white star? <br><br>But Silver offered no name. She only went on licking. <br><br>King scooted forward further to check his son himself. He sniffed the new pup from nose to tail, tail to nose again, then drew back slowly. <br><br>Something was wrong. The black pup was small. Much too small. And he was not yet breathing. <br><br>"Runt!" The name exploded from King. "This one's a runt."<br><br>The world beyond the den was a good one, but it was hard. Only the strongest, the best, the most intelligent and competent survived in it. And sometimes not even they. Two of the pups in the last litter had died before they ever emerged from the den. Their mother had taken them, one at a time, off into the forest to bury them. Would she be doing the same again? <br><br>At last, under Silver's persistent tongue, the black pup took a breath. Then another. Air filled his tiny lungs, just as it did his brothers' and sisters', and his mother drew him gently toward her belly to begin to nurse.<br><br> Only then did Silver acknowledge her mate and the name that had sprung unbidden from his lips. "He may be Runt for now," she said, laying her chin across this latest arrival, "but who knows what gift he may bring to the pack?"<br><br>"Who knows?" King repeated softly, though wasn't the pup's mother supposed to know? She always had before. "Maybe," he added, "you have a better name."<br><br>Silver was silent for a long time. "No," she said at last, "I know no other. Not yet."<br><br>Which only confirmed King's fears. His son was marked for death. <br><br>The pups' father looked long and hard at his five offspring, especially at this last, the one whose black fur and white star filled him with such love. Then, tail wagging more slowly this time, he backed toward the surface to carry this further news to the pack. <br><br>Leader, Sniffer, Runner, Thinker. Four fine pups. <br><br>And Runt. Now there was Runt.</p><h2>The Power of Hope: Let God Renew Your Mind, Heal Your Heart, and Restore Your Dreams</h2><p><b>Never Underestimate the Power of Hope</b><br> Sometimes life just isn&#x2019;t what we thought it would be.

It is the story of how the &#x201c;Party of the People&#x201d; detached itself from its historic constituency among average Americans and chose instead to line up with the winners of our new economic order.</p><p>Now with a new afterword, Thomas Frank&#x2019;s powerful analysis offers the best diagnosis to date of the liberal malady. Drawing on years of research and firsthand reporting, Frank points out that the Democrats have over the last decades increasingly abandoned their traditional goals: expanding opportunity, fighting for social justice, and ensuring that workers get a fair deal. With sardonic wit and lacerating logic, he uncovers the corporate and cultural elitism that have largely eclipsed the party&#x2019;s old working- and middle-class commitment. And he warns that the Democrats&#x2019; only chance of regaining their health and averting a future of ever-increasing inequality is a return to their historic faith.</p></p><p><b>THOMAS FRANK</b> is the author of <i>Pity the Billionaire</i>, <i>The Wrecking Crew</i>, and <i>What&#x2019;s the Matter with Kansas</i>?.

He lives outside Washington, D.C.<p>&#x201c;Thoroughly entertaining . . . Frank delights in skewering the sacred cows of coastal liberalism. . . . He argues that the Democratic party&#x2015;once 'the Party of the People'&#x2015;now caters to the interests of a 'professional managerial class' consisting of lawyers, doctors, professors, scientists, programmers, even investment bankers. . . .

In such a looking-glass world, <i>Listen, Liberal </i>is a desperately needed corrective.&#x201d;&#x2015;History News Network</p><p>&#x201c;In his new book, progressive commentator Thomas Frank says Democrats need to take a good long look in the mirror if they want answers to why blue-collar workers are feeling abandoned and even infuriated by what used to be their party.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>New York Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Over the past four decades, Frank argues, the Democrats have embraced a new favorite constituency: the professional class&#x2015;the doctors, lawyers, engineers, programmers, entrepreneurs, artists, writers, financiers and other so-called creatives whose fetish for academic credentials and technological innovation has infected the party of the working class. . . . For that class, Frank argues, income and wealth inequality is not a problem but an inevitable condition.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;An astute dissection of contemporary Democratic politics that demonstrates, cogently and at times acidly, how the party lost the allegiance of blue-collar Americans.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;A tough and thought-provoking look at what&#x2019;s wrong with America . . .

If the prevailing ideology of the Republican establishment is that of a sneering aristocracy, Democratic elites are all too often the purveyors of a smirking meritocracy that offers working people very little.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>The Huffington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;Democrats often use the fact that Republicans have gone off the deep end to ignore their left flank, on the grounds that those liberals have nowhere else to go politically. <i>Listen, Liberal</i> contributes to the literature that expresses deep frustration with that decision, the fuel for a revolt.&#x201d;&#x2015;<i>The Fiscal Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;As with Frank&#x2019;s other books, <i>Listen, Liberal</i> is a piece of contemporary history that tells us not only what the powerful are up to, but how the trick is being pulled, with an admirable deployment of irony. . . .

But everything is more fun with company, so Mr. Peanuts writes a letter to Cousin Squirrel and invites him for a visit!<br>Featuring candid photographs of wild squirrels in handcrafted, homemade miniature settings, this irresistible book is sure to delight readers young and old!</p><p>Nancy Rose is a photographer living in Canada. Her popular photos of wild squirrels in handcrafted settings, taken in her backyard, have attracted a wide following on Flickr, and have been featured in the <i>Washington Post</i>, the London <i>Times</i>, and <i>Buzzfeed</i>, among many others.PreS-Gr 1&#x2014;Rose photographs wild squirrels exploring miniature dollhouse-type sets constructed in her backyard. The story is built around the photos of squirrels interacting with tiny, handmade props. Readers first meet Mr. Peanuts as he pursues his hobbies: cooking on a grill, playing a piano, and engaging with several books in a library set. Feeling lonely, Mr. Peanuts pens a letter, inviting Cousin Squirrel to visit. He prepares for his friend's arrival by cleaning his house, baking a cake, and taking a bath. Once Cousin Squirrel arrives, the two animals sit in a wagon together, enjoy a picnic, and camp out. Rather than being plot- or character-driven, the text seems to exist only to showcase and loosely tie the pictures together. The book ends with "Ten Tips for Photographing Wildlife" and a "Q &amp; A with Nancy Rose." Children may enjoy visually examining Mr. Peanuts' miniature world, but the lackluster text makes this an additional purchase.&#x2014;Laura Hunter, Mount Laurel Library, NJ</p><h2>Do You Have the Guts to Be Beautiful: Simple, natural practices for reversing wrinkles, blemishes, graying, and baldness, and feeling young again</h2><p>Our looks are a window to the state of our health.

You can email him at tenpoems@juno.com.Editor Housden is a dab hand at using poetry as a means to spiritual fulfillment (<i>Ten</i> Poems to Change Your Life, 2001; <i>Ten Poems to Open Your Heart</i> [BKL Ja 1 &amp; 15 03]). Now he demonstrates that he really knows poetry in an inspirational anthology sans inspirational chestnuts. Oh, Emily Dickinson is here, but with the hoydenish "Wild Nights." The love Housden encourages includes sex--see the Anna Swir selections and Galway Kinnell's "Rapture"--and the spirituality he fosters is active even at its quietest, when the soul of existence is suddenly apprehended. Given that agenda, Robert Bly is all over the book, as poet and translator (Housden invariably picks the often-arid Bly at his juiciest), and the Sufis Rumi and Hafiz are here: for Housden, ecstasy is a touchstone of true love and spirituality. But so, it seems, is domesticity (see Wendell Berry's "One Faith Is Bondage") and even morality (see T. S. Eliot's "The Dove Descending"). Only once is a note of New Age solipsism struck. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

They are found in all complex living things, and in that sense, they are fundamental for driving complex life on the planet. But there is much more to them than that. <br><br>Mitochondria have their own DNA, with their own small collection of genes, separate from those in the cell nucleus. It is thought that they were once bacteria living independent lives. Their enslavement within the larger cell was a turning point in the evolution of life, enabling the development of complex organisms and, closely related, the origin of two sexes. Unlike the DNA in the nucleus, mitochondrial DNA is passed down exclusively (or almost exclusively) via the female line. That's why it has been used by some researchers to trace human ancestry daughter to mother, to 'Mitochondrial Eve'. Mitochondria give us important information about our evolutionary history. And that's not all. Mitochondrial genes mutate much faster than those in the nucleus because of the free radicals produced in their energy generating role. This high mutation rate lies behind our ageing and certain congenital diseases. The latest research suggests that mitochondria play a key role in degenerative diseases such as cancer, through their involvement in precipitating cell suicide. <br><br>Mitochondria, then, are pivotal in power, sex, and suicide. In this fascinating and thought provoking book, Nick Lane brings together the latest research findings in this exciting field to show how our growing understanding of mitochondria is shedding light on how complex life evolved, why sex arose (why don't we just bud?), and why we age and die. This understanding is of fundamental importance, both in understanding how we and all other complex life came to be, but also in order to be able to control our own illnesses, and delay our degeneration and death. <br><br>Oxford Landmark Science books are 'must read' classics of modern science writing which have crystallized big ideas, and shaped the way we think.<br></p><p><br>Nick Lane, <em>Professor of Evolutionary Biochemistry, University College London</em><br><br>Nick Lane is a British biochemist and writer.

His works include <i>The Boy and the Whale</i>, <i>How to Bicycle to the Moon to Plant Sunflowers</i>, and illustrations for <i>Applesauce Season</i>.In 1974, Philippe Petit, a French aerialist and street performer, disguised himself as a construction worker and shot a strong wire from one tower of the World Trade Center to the other. In a death-defying dance, Petit crossed the 140 feet between the towers, a quarter of a mile above New York City. Petit was arrested and sentenced to perform for children in the parks. Gerstein's reading is congenial and disarming. His images are spare yet lyrical, magical and poetic; his performance, completely engaging. His understated delivery captures Petit's playful nature, his delight in imagining himself in the space between the towers, and his satisfaction at achieving the impossible. The closing somber words, "Now the towers are gone," create an indelible memory, part joy, part grief.

In fact, I loved her more than I&#x2019;d ever imagined it was possible to love a person. The reality we lived in, though? Well, let&#x2019;s just say I&#x2019;d never really imagined anything like that either. In all our previous fantasies, we&#x2019;d dreamed of exotic locations and, most importantly, freedom. Being cooped up in a small suite of rooms had never been part of any escape plan, let alone a romantic getaway.</p><p>But I was never one to back down from a challenge.</p><p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this?&#x201d; asked Sydney, startled.</p><p>&#x201c;Happy anniversary,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>She&#x2019;d just finished getting showered and dressed and now stood in the bathroom&#x2019;s doorway, staring around at the transformation I&#x2019;d wrought in our living room. It hadn&#x2019;t been easy doing so much in so little time. Sydney was an efficient person, and that extended to showers as well. Me? You could have conducted full demolition and remodeling in the time it took me to shower. With Sydney, there&#x2019;d been barely enough time to decorate the place in candles and flowers. But I&#x2019;d managed.</p><p>A smile crept over her face. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s only been one month.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, don&#x2019;t say &#x2018;only,&#x2019;&#x201d; I warned. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s still monumental. And I&#x2019;ll have you know that I plan on celebrating every month for the rest of our lives.&#x201d;</p><p>Her smile turned into a full-on grin as she ran her fingers over the petals of a vase full of flowers. It made my heart ache. I couldn&#x2019;t remember the last time I&#x2019;d seen such a genuine smile on her. &#x201c;You even got peonies,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;How&#x2019;d you manage that?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, I have my ways,&#x201d; I stated loftily.</p><p><i>Though it&#x2019;s probably better she doesn&#x2019;t know what those ways are</i>, a voice in my head warned.</p><p>Sydney strolled around and assessed the rest of my handiwork, which included a bottle of red wine and a box of chocolate truffles artfully set out on the kitchen table. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it a little early in the day?&#x201d; she teased.</p><p>&#x201c;Depends on whom you&#x2019;re asking,&#x201d; I said, nodding toward the dark window. &#x201c;For you, it&#x2019;s technically evening.&#x201d;</p><p>Her smile dimmed a little. &#x201c;Honestly, I hardly ever know what time it is anymore.&#x201d;</p><p><i>This lifestyle is taking its toll on her</i>, my inner voice warned. <i>Just look at her.</i></p><p>Even in the flickering light of the candles, I could see signs of the stress Sydney was feeling. Dark shadows under her eyes. A perpetually weary look&#x2014;born more of despair than fatigue. She was the only human at the royal Moroi Court who wasn&#x2019;t here specifically to feed us vampires. She was also the only human in any civilized Moroi place to have married one of us. Doing so had meant incurring the wrath of her own people and cutting herself off from friends and family (the ones who were still speaking to her, at least) in the outside world. And thanks to the scorn and prying looks she received around Court, Sydney had pretty much cut herself off from people here as well, narrowing her whole world down to our suite of rooms.</p><p>&#x201c;Wait, there&#x2019;s more,&#x201d; I said quickly, hoping to distract her. With a button push, classical music began playing through the living room&#x2019;s sound system. I extended my hand to her. &#x201c;Since we didn&#x2019;t get to dance at our wedding.&#x201d;</p><p>That brought the smile back. She took my hand and let me draw her close. I twirled her around the room, careful not to bump any of the candles, and she regarded me with amusement. &#x201c;What are you doing? It&#x2019;s a waltz. It has three beats. Can&#x2019;t you hear it? One-two-three, one-two-three.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? That&#x2019;s what a waltz is? Huh. I just picked something that sounded fancy. Since we don&#x2019;t really have a song or anything.&#x201d; I pondered that for a second. &#x201c;I guess we&#x2019;ve failed as a couple in that regard.&#x201d;</p><p>She scoffed. &#x201c;If that&#x2019;s our biggest failing, then I think we&#x2019;re doing okay.&#x201d;</p><p>Long moments passed as I danced her around the room, then I suddenly said, &#x201c;&#x2018;She Blinded Me With Science.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; Sydney asked.</p><p>&#x201c;That could be our song.&#x201d;</p><p>She laughed outright, and I realized I hadn&#x2019;t heard that sound in a very long time. It somehow managed to make my heart both ache and leap. &#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I guess that&#x2019;s better than &#x2018;Tainted Love.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>We both laughed then, and she rested her cheek against my chest. I kissed the top of her golden head, taking in the mingled scents of her soap and skin. &#x201c;It feels wrong,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;To be happy, I mean. When Jill&#x2019;s out there&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>At that name, my heart sank, and a heavy darkness threatened to descend on me and shatter this small moment of joy I&#x2019;d created. I had to forcibly push away the darkness, making myself step back from a dangerous precipice I knew all too well these days. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find her,&#x201d; I whispered, tightening my hold on Sydney. &#x201c;Wherever she is, we&#x2019;ll find her.&#x201d;</p><p><i>If she&#x2019;s still alive</i>, that inner voice said nastily.</p><p>It&#x2019;s probably worth pointing out that the voice that kept speaking in my head wasn&#x2019;t part of some mental exercise. It was actually a very distinct voice, belonging to my dead aunt Tatiana, former queen of the Moroi. She wasn&#x2019;t with me in any ghostly form, though. Her voice was a delusion, born out of the increasing grip insanity was taking on me, thanks to the rare type of magic I used. A quick prescription would have shut her up, but it also would&#x2019;ve cut me off from my magic, and our world was too unpredictable right now for me to do that. And so this phantom Aunt Tatiana and I had become roommates in my mind. Sometimes that delusional presence terrified me, making me wonder how long it would be until I completely lost it. At other times, I found myself taking her in stride&#x2014;and that scared me even more, that I was coming to regard her as normal.</p><p>For now, I managed to ignore Aunt Tatiana as I kissed Sydney again. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll find Jill,&#x201d; I said more firmly. &#x201c;And in the meantime, we have to keep living our lives.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose so,&#x201d; said Sydney with a sigh. I could tell she was trying to summon back that earlier cheer. &#x201c;If this is supposed to make up for our lack of a wedding dance, I feel kind of underdressed. Maybe I should go dig out that gown.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No way,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Not that that dress wasn&#x2019;t great. But I kind of like you underdressed. In fact, I wouldn&#x2019;t mind if you were a lot more underdressed&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>I stopped waltzing (or whatever dance move it was I&#x2019;d been attempting to do) and brought my mouth down to hers in a very different sort of kiss than the one I&#x2019;d just given her. Heat filled me as I felt the softness of her lips, and I was surprised to sense an answering passion in her. In light of our recent circumstances, Sydney hadn&#x2019;t been feeling particularly physical, and honestly, I couldn&#x2019;t blame her. I&#x2019;d respected her wishes and kept my distance&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. not realizing how much I&#x2019;d missed that fire in her until now.</p><p>We found ourselves sinking down onto the couch, arms wrapped tightly around each other, still kissing passionately. I paused to study her, admiring the way the candlelight shone on her blond hair and brown eyes. I could&#x2019;ve drowned in that beauty, that and the love I could feel radiating off of her. It was a perfect, much-needed romantic moment&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. at least, it was until the door opened.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom?&#x201d; I exclaimed, leaping off Sydney like I was a high school kid and not a married man of twenty-two.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, hello, dear,&#x201d; my mother said, strolling into the living room. &#x201c;Why are all the lights off? It looks like a mausoleum in here. Was the power out?&#x201d; She flipped on a light switch, making both Sydney and me wince. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s back now. But you really shouldn&#x2019;t have lit so many candles. It&#x2019;s dangerous.&#x201d; She helpfully blew a cluster out.</p><p>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; said Sydney flatly. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nice to know you&#x2019;re taking safety seriously.&#x201d; Her expression reminded me of the time my mother had &#x201c;helpfully&#x201d; pulled out a bunch of sticky notes that were &#x201c;cluttering up&#x201d; a book Sydney had spent hours painstakingly notating.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom, I thought you were going to be gone a couple of hours,&#x201d; I said pointedly.</p><p>&#x201c;I was, but it was just getting too awkward over at the feeders&#x2019; salon. You&#x2019;d think everyone would be busy at the council meeting, but no. So many stares. I couldn&#x2019;t relax. So they just let me bring one with me.&#x201d; She glanced around. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;d he go? Ah, there.&#x201d; She stepped back out into the hallway and steered in a dazed-looking human who was a little older than me. &#x201c;Sit over there on that chair, and I&#x2019;ll be right with you.&#x201d;</p><p>I leapt to my feet. &#x201c;You brought a feeder here? Mom, you know how Sydney feels about that.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney made no comment but blanched at the sight of the feeder sitting across the room. His eyes&#x2014;dazed and happy from the endorphins he received from letting vampires feed off of him&#x2014;stared around blankly.</p><p>My mother sighed in exasperation. &#x201c;What do you expect me to do, darling? There was absolutely <i>no way</i> I could feed with Maureen Tarus and Gladys Dashkov sitting there and gossiping right beside me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I expect you to have a little consideration for my wife!&#x201d; I exclaimed. Since Sydney and I had gotten married and sought refuge at Court, most people&#x2014;including my own father&#x2014;had turned their backs on us. My mom had stood by us, even going so far as to live with us&#x2014;which wasn&#x2019;t without its complications.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure she can just wait in your bedroom,&#x201d; my mother said, leaning over to blow out more candles. Spotting the truffles on the table, she paused to pop one in her mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;Sydney doesn&#x2019;t have to go hide away in her own home,&#x201d; I argued.</p><p>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; said my mother, &#x201c;neither do I. It&#x2019;s my home too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t mind,&#x201d; said Sydney, getting to her feet. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wait.&#x201d;</p><p>I was so frustrated, I wanted to rip my hair out. Passion was no longer the issue. All traces of that earlier happiness I&#x2019;d seen in Sydney were gone. She was retreating back into herself, back to that hopeless feeling of being a human stuck in a world of vampires. And then, impossibly, things got worse. My mother had noticed one of the peony vases.</p><p>&#x201c;These are beautiful,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Melinda must have been so grateful for that healing.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney froze mid-step. &#x201c;What healing?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not important,&#x201d; I said hastily, hoping my mother would get the hint. At other times, Daniella Ivashkov was a remarkably astute woman. Today, however, she seemed to be in fully oblivious mode.</p><p>&#x201c;Melinda Rowe, the Court florist,&#x201d; my mother explained. &#x201c;Adrian and I ran into her the last time we were out at a feeding. She was having a terrible acne flare-up, and Adrian was nice enough to speed along its healing. She promised to help get some peonies in stock in return.&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney turned on me, speechless in her fury. Needing to calm this situation immediately, I grabbed hold of her arm and pulled her into our bedroom. &#x201c;Make it fast,&#x201d; I called to my mom, just before I shut the door.</p><p>Sydney lashed out immediately. &#x201c;Adrian, how could you? You promised! You promised no more spirit, unless it was to help find Jill!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It was nothing,&#x201d; I insisted. &#x201c;It hardly took any power at all.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It adds up!&#x201d; Sydney cried. &#x201c;You know it does. Every little bit. You can&#x2019;t waste it on stuff like this&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. on someone&#x2019;s acne!&#x201d;</p><p>Although I understood why she was upset, I couldn&#x2019;t help but feel a bit hurt. &#x201c;I did it for us. For our anniversary. I thought you&#x2019;d like it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What I&#x2019;d like is for my husband to stay sane,&#x201d; she snapped back.</p><p>&#x201c;Well, we&#x2019;re long past that,&#x201d; I said.</p><p><i>She doesn&#x2019;t know the half of it</i>, remarked Aunt Tatiana.</p><p>Sydney crossed her arms and sat on the bed. &#x201c;See? There you go. Making a joke of everything. This is serious, Adrian.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m being serious. I know what I can handle.&#x201d;</p><p>She met my gaze levelly. &#x201c;Do you? I still think you&#x2019;d be better off stopping spirit altogether. Go back on your pills. It&#x2019;s safest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about finding Jill?&#x201d; I reminded her. &#x201c;What if we need my spirit magic for that?&#x201d;</p><p>Sydney looked away. &#x201c;Well, it hasn&#x2019;t been of much use so far. No one&#x2019;s magic has.&#x201d;</p><p>That last remark was a condemnation of herself as much as of me. Our friend Jill Mastrano Dragomir had been kidnapped a month ago, and so far, our efforts to find her had been for nothing. I hadn&#x2019;t been able to reach Jill in spirit dreams, nor had Sydney&#x2014;an adept student of human witchcraft&#x2014;been able to locate her using the spells at her disposal. The best Sydney&#x2019;s magic had been able to tell us was that Jill was still alive, but that was it. The general belief was that wherever she was, Jill was being drugged&#x2014;which could effectively hide someone from both human and Moroi magic. It didn&#x2019;t stop us from both feeling useless, though. We both cared about Jill immensely&#x2014;and my relationship with her was particularly intense since I&#x2019;d once used spirit magic to bring her back from the brink of death. Not knowing what had happened to her now had cast a shadow over Sydney and me&#x2014;and any attempts at happiness we&#x2019;d mustered while under this self-imposed house arrest.</p><p>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;When we do find her, I need my magic. There&#x2019;s no telling what I&#x2019;ll need to do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Like fix her acne?&#x201d; asked Sydney.</p><p>I flinched. &#x201c;I told you, it was nothing! Let me worry about me and how much spirit I can use. It&#x2019;s not your job.&#x201d;</p><p>She turned incredulous. &#x201c;Of course it is! I&#x2019;m your wife, Adrian. If I&#x2019;m not going to worry about you, who will? You need to keep spirit in check.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can handle it,&#x201d; I said through gritted teeth.</p><p>&#x201c;Is your aunt still talking to you?&#x201d; she demanded.</p><p>I looked away, refusing to meet her eye. In my head, Aunt Tatiana sighed. <i>You never should have told her about me.</i></p><p>At my silence, Sydney said, &#x201c;She is, isn&#x2019;t she? Adrian, that&#x2019;s not healthy! You have to know that!&#x201d;</p><p>I spun around in anger. &#x201c;I can handle it. Okay? I can handle it, and I can handle her!&#x201d; I shouted. &#x201c;So stop telling me what to do! You don&#x2019;t know everything&#x2014;no matter how much you want everyone to think you do!&#x201d;</p><p>Stricken, Sydney took a step back. The pain in her eyes hurt me a lot more than her earlier words had. I felt terrible. How had this day gone so wrong? It was supposed to have been perfect. Suddenly, I needed to get out. I couldn&#x2019;t stand these four walls anymore. I couldn&#x2019;t stand my mother&#x2019;s control. I couldn&#x2019;t stand feeling like I was always disappointing Sydney&#x2014;and Jill. Sydney and I had come to Court to seek protection from our enemies, hiding here so we could be together. Lately, it seemed like this arrangement was in danger of tearing us apart.</p><p>&#x201c;I have to get out,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>Sydney&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;To where?&#x201d;</p><p>I raked a hand through my hair. &#x201c;Anywhere. Anywhere to get some air. Anywhere but here.&#x201d;</p><p>I turned before she could say anything and stormed out through the living room, past where my mom was drinking from the feeder. She gave me a quizzical look, but I ignored it and kept on going until I was out our door and through the lobby of the guest-housing building. It wasn&#x2019;t until I emerged outside, until the balmy summer air hit my skin, that I paused to evaluate my actions&#x2014;and pop a piece of gum, which was my current way to avoid smoking when stressed. I stared back up at the building, feeling guilty and cowardly for running out on our fight.</p><p><i>Don&#x2019;t fee...</i></p></p><h2>Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships: Healing the Wound of the Heart</h2><p>While most of us have moments of loving freely and openly, it is often hard to sustain this where it matters most&#x2014;in our intimate relationships. Why, if love is so great and powerful, are human relationships so challenging and difficult? If love is the source of happiness and joy, why is it so hard to open to it fully and let it govern our lives? In this book, John Welwood addresses these questions and shows us how to overcome the most fundamental obstacle that keeps us from experiencing love's full flowering in our lives. <br> <br> <i>Perfect Love, Imperfect Relationships</i> begins by showing how all our relational problems arise out of a universal, core wounding around love that affects not only our personal relationships but the quality of life in our world as a whole. This wounding shows up as a pervasive <i>mood of unlove</i>&#x2014;a deep sense that we are not intrinsically lovable just as we are. And this shuts down our capacity to trust, so that even though we may hunger for love, we have difficulty opening to it and letting it circulate freely through us. <br> <br>This book takes the reader on a powerful journey of healing and transformation that involves learning to embrace our humanness and appreciate the imperfections of our relationships as trail-markers along the path to great love. It sets forth a process for releasing deep-seated grievances we hold against others for not loving us better and against ourselves for not being better loved. And it shows how our longing to be loved can magnetize the great love that will free us from looking to others to find ourselves. <br> <br>Written with penetrating realism and a fresh, lyrical style that honors the subtlety and richness of our relationship to love itself, this revolutionary book offers profound and practical guidance for healing our lives as well as our embattled world.</p><p>As a psychotherapist, teacher, and author, John Welwood has been a pioneer in integrating psychological and spiritual work. Welwood has published six books, including the best-selling <i>Journey of the Heart </i> (HarperCollins, 1990), as well as <i>Challenge of the Heart </i> (Shambhala, 1985), and <i>Love and Awakening </i> (HarperCollins, 1996). He is an associate editor of the <i>Journal for Transpersonal Psychology. </i>He leads workshops and trainings in psychospiritual work and conscious relationship throughout the world.All the most intractable problems in human relationships can be traced back to what I call the mood of unlove &#x2014;a deep insecurity that most people harbor within themselves about being loved or lovable just for who they are. This doubt about our connection to love makes it hard to trust in ourselves, other people, life, or love itself.<br><br>The mood of unlove often shows up in the form of instant emotional reactivity to any perception of being slighted or treated badly. It's as though a huge reservoir of distrust and resentment is ready and waiting to be released&#x2014;which the tiniest incident can trigger. For some couples, these emotional eruptions happen early on, blowing a budding relationship apart in their first few encounters. For others, the mood of unlove might not wreak its havoc until well into a seemingly happy marriage, when one or both partners suddenly wake up one day and realize they don't feel truly loved.<br><br>Fortunately, just as the sun is never permanently obscured by clouds, so our native capacity for love, for genuine warmth and openness, cannot be destroyed. To say that our heart is wounded means that we are lost in clouds that temporarily block our access to the sun that is always shining. Healing the love-wound, then, involves something like opening up spaces in the clouds and inviting the sun to do what it naturally wants to do: shine upon us.</p><h2>First, We Sing!

Cinderella. Her story has been passed down the centuries and across continents. Now Paul Fleischman and Julie Paschkis craft its many versions into one hymn to the rich variety and the enduring constants of our cultures.</p><p><b>A Junior Library Guild Selection</b></p><p><i>Glass Slipper, Gold Sandal: A Worldwide Cinderella</i> is a 2008 Bank Street - Best Children's Book of the Year.</p></p><p><p><b>Paul Fleischman</b> won a Newbery Medal for <i>Joyful Noise</i> and a Newbery Honor for <i>Graven Images</i>. He is also the author of young adult novels including <i>Whirligig </i>and <i>The Mind's Eye</i>, and middle-grade novels including <i>Bull Run</i> and <i>Seedfolks</i>. He lives with his wife in northern California.</p><p><b>Julie Paschkis</b> won a <i>Boston Globe</i>-Horn Book Honor for <i>Yellow Elephant</i>. She lives in Seattle.</p><i>Starred Review.</i> Beneath its handsome William Morris&#x2013;like cover art, this inspired retelling blends many versions of Cinderella into a single, extraordinary tale. As Newbery Medalist Fleischman's (<i>Joyful Noise</i>) strong storytelling voice incorporates sometimes small details from different traditions, text and illustrations nimbly morph from one Cinderella story to the next, creating this brand-new version. Paschkis (<i>Yellow Elephant</i>) makes use of folk art and textile patterns throughout the world in the clever background paintings behind each of her vibrant panel illustrations, and she helpfully and unobtrusively labels the country from which relevant borrowings originate. Generally, each page focuses on a single country's contributions, but even when details from several countries share a spread, visual harmony prevails and characters remain recognizable despite their costume changes. When Cinderella has nothing to wear, for example, a crocodile swam up to the surface&#x2014;and in its mouth was a sarong made of gold [Indonesia]... a cloak sewn of kingfisher feathers [China]... a kimono red as sunset [Japan]. Even the last line of text is patched from several sources: Such a wedding it was, and such an adoring couple [Iraq]... and such a wondrous turn of events [Korea]... that people today are still telling the story. Paschkis emphasizes the storyteller's voice by beginning and ending the narrative with illustrations of a mother reading to her daughter&#x2014;a daughter who, appropriately, looks much like Cinderella herself.Ages 5-up. <i>(Sept.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

She taught about this path with the perspective of the ascended masters for the benefit of all who desire to make great spiritual progress in this lifetime.I almost gave up studying the Kabbalah in depth given the difficulty and general &#34;user-unfriendliness&#34; of most deeper books. Have you ever tried starting with the 3-volume &#34;Wisdom of the Zohar&#34;?? This book is astonishing in that while there is always more scope for study of this subject of course, Prophet&#39;s work is not only by far the best introduction to Kabbalism, but gave me the best idea of the subject&#39;s history and origins, the purpose and use of this esoteric system, and even topics barely mentioned elsewhere. For example, what did the original Kabbalistic mystics actually DO? How does the Kabbalah connect with the subject of twin souls? And how to use &#34;the science of the spoken word&#34; in conjunction with the Kabbalah?

Kathleen is the author of numerous Bible studies and books, and serves on the Board of Directors of the Charles Simeon Trust. She is married to Niel and they have three sons and five granddaughters.Kathleen Nielson proficiently unpacks difficult passages of Scripture that we sometimes want to avoid. On every page, she helps us wrestle with complex questions, while inviting us to embrace this beautiful truth: God is good to women. This is an excellent and needed book I highly recommend it for both men and women.<br> --<b>Melissa Kruger</b>, Author of <i>The Envy of Eve</i> and <i>Walking with God in the Season of Motherhood</i><br><br> Kathleen Nielson examines hard questions about women and God that some might be afraid to ask: Is God for women? Does he like us? Using God's own words in Scripture, Nielson teaches us that the answer is a resounding Yes! <br> --<b>Colleen J. McFadden</b>, Director of Women's Workshops, Charles Simeon Trust<br><br> In our day, debate over the treatment of women, especially in the church, is one of the hot topics. I hope that many readers on all sides of this debate will take the time and invest the energy to listen carefully and respectfully to Kathleen, a woman who has a keen mind, a heart devoted to Scripture, and the courtesy to treat other viewpoints fairly even while she marshals the evidence that supports her understanding of key passages and themes.<br> --<b>D.A. Carson</b>, Research Professor of New Testament, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, Illinois; President, The Gospel Coalition<br><br> I am encouraged by this book, which takes on a subject that is not easy or popular as it grapples with some seriously hard questions and helps equip us to answer them from God's word. As you read the book, it is easy to see that Kathleen herself delights in the goodness of God's plan for women as she carefully and winsomely seeks to show us how that goodness runs throughout the whole Bible. <br> --<b>Andrea Trevenna</b>, Associate Minister for Women, St Nicholas, Sevenoaks, UK; author of The Heart of Singleness<br><br> I loved this book! Women and God is more than just an overview of the roles of women in the family and the church. It tackles all the usual texts as well as the more shocking and perplexing ones that other people sometimes avoid. Kathleen anticipates all the questions and objections that people have, and then answers them from the text with wisdom, clarity, and sensitivity. What makes this book so compelling is her conviction that God is good, and that women can have confidence that living by his word is a beautiful thing and for our good.<br> --<b>Carrie Sandom</b>, Director of Women s Ministry, The Proclamation Trust, London; Associate Minister for Women at St John's, Tunbridge Wells, UK<br><br> I was deeply helped by reading Women and God. It is a book written by a wise woman, and it does not shy away from hard, painful, complex issues. Frankly, there are few people I trust more than Dr. Nielson to push me, challenge me, and make me think rigorously, carefully, and biblically about these things. This book is faithful and sensitive, truthful and persuasive, restrained yet comprehensive. <br> --<b>Ligon Duncan</b>, Chancellor, Reformed Theological Seminary, Jackson, Mississippi<br><br>At a time when there is increasing confusion and perhaps resistance to God's word about gender, Kathleen offers a clear and wise path to understanding God's word rightly in this important area. Don't be fooled into thinking this is a book just for women. This is an excellent resource for men as well, as we all grapple with the Bible's teaching on what it means to be a woman.<br> --<b>Kara Hartley</b>, Archdeacon for Women's Ministry, Diocese of Sydney, Australia<br><br> I applaud Kathleen Nielson's courage in facing some difficult questions head-on and I think many will benefit from her thorough approach and carefully argued insights. Often the issues dealt with in this book are fraught with emotion, which obscures careful reasoning. Kathleen keeps us fixed on the word of God, while showing his love and compassion toward women.<br> --<b>Wendy Virgo</b>, Author of <i>Influential Women</i> and international speaker<br><br> I have started to read loads of books on women, but this one is unique partly because I finished it! In fact I couldn't put it down. Kathleen has gathered all the tricky questions about women and tackles them head-on. As I read about what I was created for, I was moved to tears and felt a burden lift from my shoulders. Every chapter brings fresh insights as Kathleen unflinchingly grapples with tricky verses. It's simple, accessible, up to date and down to earth, and is a book I will keep coming back to.<br> --<b>Linda Allcock</b>, London Women's Convention<br><br> In Women and God, we find a writer well prepared to walk through the interior world of godly women who are in need of good answers. In reading it, I had the sense that Kathleen Nielson's voice will encourage, assist, and support Christian women who have reason to feel that the goodness of God has escaped them. <br> --<b>David Helm</b>, Lead Pastor, Holy Trinity Church, Hyde Park, Chicago; Chairman, The Simeon Trust<br><br> It is with great joy that I recommend Women and God. What I like most about this book is not that it is written by a woman for women but that it is written by a faithful Bible-teacher who happens to be a woman. Kathleen answers the hard questions the Bible raises in relation to women by showing us the beauty of the truths of Scripture and the glory of our Savior, Jesus. <br> --<b>Juan Sanchez</b>, Senior Pastor, High Pointe Baptist Church, Austin, Texas; author of <i>7 Dangers Facing Your Church</i></p><h2>This Is Not A Book</h2><p><p><strong>A playfully deceptive format that encourages young readers to see things differently.

She lives in Texas.&nbsp;Chapter 1Propped upon a mountain of satin pillows amid rumpled bed linens, Helene Devernay surveyed his bronzed, muscular torso with an appreciative smile as Stephen David Elliott Westmoreland, Earl of Langford, Baron of Ellingwood, Fifth Viscount Hargrove, Viscount Ashbourne, shrugged into the frilled shirt he'd tossed over the foot of the bed last night. "Are we still attending the theatre next week?" she asked.<br>Stephen glanced at her in surprise as he picked up his neckcloth. "Of course." Turning to the mirror above the fireplace, he met her gaze in it while he deftly wrapped the fine white silk into intricate folds around his neck. "Why did you need to ask?"<br>"Because the Season begins next week, and Monica Fitzwaring is coming to town. I heard it from my dressmaker, who is also hers."<br>"And?" he said, looking steadily at her in the mirror, his expression betraying not even a flicker of reaction.<br>With a sigh, Helene rolled onto her side and leaned on an elbow, her tone regretful but frank. "And gossip has it that you're finally going to make her the offer she and her father have been waiting for these three years past."<br>"Is that what the gossips are saying?" he asked casually, but he lifted his brows slightly, in a gesture that silently, and very effectively, managed to convey his displeasure with Helene for introducing a topic that he clearly felt was none of her concern.<br>Helene noted the unspoken reprimand and the warning it carried, but she took advantage of what had been a remarkably open -- and highly pleasurable -- affair for both of them for several years. "In the past, there have been dozens of rumors that you were on the verge of offering for one aspiring female or another," she pointed out quietly, "and, until now, I have never asked you to verify or deny any of them."<br>Without answering, Stephen turned from the mirror and picked up his evening jacket from the flowered chaise longue. He shoved his arms into the sleeves, then he walked over to the side of the bed and finally directed all his attention to the woman in it. Standing there, looking down at her, he felt his annoyance diminish considerably. Propped up on her elbow, with her golden hair spilling over her naked back and breasts, Helene Devernay was a delectable sight. She was also intelligent, direct, and sophisticated, all of which made her a thoroughly delightful mistress both in and out of bed. He knew she was too practical to nurture any secret hopes of a marriage offer from him, which was absolutely out of the question for a woman in her circumstances, and she was too independent to have any real desire to tie herself to someone for life -- traits that further solidified their relationship. Or so he had thought. "But now you are asking me to confirm or deny that I intend to offer for Monica Fitzwaring?" he asked quietly.<br>Helene gave him a warm, seductive smile that normally made his body respond. "I am."<br>Brushing back the sides of his jacket, Stephen put his hands on his hips and regarded her coolly. "And if I said yes?"<br>"Then, my lord, I would say that you are making a great mistake. You have a fondness for her, but not a great love nor even a great passion. All she has to offer you is her beauty, her bloodlines, and the prospect of an heir. She hasn't your strength of will, nor your intelligence, and although she may care for you, she will never understand you. She will bore you in bed and out of it, and you will intimidate, hurt, and anger her."<br>"Thank you, Helene. I must count myself fortunate that you take such an interest in my personal life and that you are so willing to share your expertise on how I ought to live it."<br>The stinging setdown caused her smile to fade a little but not disappear. "There, you see?" she asked softly. "I am duly chastened and forewarned by that tone of yours, but Monica Fitzwaring would be either completely crushed or mortally offended."<br>She watched his expression harden at the same time his voice became extremely polite, chillingly so. "My apologies, madame," he said, inclining his head in a mockery of a bow, "if I have ever addressed you in a tone that is less than civil."<br>Reaching up, Helene tugged on his jacket in an attempt to make him sit down on the bed beside her. When this failed, she dropped her hand, but not the issue, and widened her smile to soothe his temper. "You never speak to anyone in an uncivil tone, Stephen. In fact, the more annoyed you are, the more 'civil' you become -- until you are so very civil, so very precise and correct, that the effect is actually quite alarming. One might even say...<i>terrifying!"</i><br>She shivered to illustrate, and Stephen grinned in spite of himself.<br>"That is what I meant," she said, smiling back at him. "When you grow cold and angry, I know how -- " Her breath caught as his large hand slippeddown beneath the sheet and covered her breast, his fingers tantalizing her.<br>"I merely wish to warm you," he said, as she reached her arms around his neck and drew him down on the bed.<br>"And distract me."<br>"I think a fur would do a far better job of that."<br>"Of warming me?"<br>"Of distracting you," he said as his mouth covered hers, and then he went about the pleasurable business of warming, and distracting, both of them.<br>It was nearly five o'clock in the morning when he was dressed again.<br>"Stephen?" she whispered sleepily as he bent and pressed a farewell kiss upon her smooth brow.<br>"Mmmm?"<br>"I have a confession."<br>"No confessions," he reminded her. "We agreed on that from the beginning. No confessions, no recriminations, no promises. That was the way we both wanted it."<br>Helene didn't deny it, but this morning she couldn't make herself comply. "My confession is that I find myself rather annoyingly jealous of Monica Fitzwaring."<br>Stephen straightened with an impatient sigh, and waited, knowing she was determined to have her say, but he did not help her do it. He simply regarded her with raised brows.<br>"I realize you need an heir," she began, her full lips curving into an embarrassed smile, "but could you not wed a female whose looks pale a little in comparison with mine? Someone shrewish too. A shrew with a slightly crooked nose or small eyes would suit me very well."<br>Stephen chuckled at her humor, but he wanted the subject closed permanently, and so he said, "Monica Fitzwaring is no threat to you, Helene. I've no doubtshe knows of our relationship and she would not try to interfere, even if she thought she could."<br>"What makes you so certain?"<br>"She volunteered the information," he said flatly, and when Helene still looked unconvinced, he added, "In the interest of putting an end to your concern and to this entire topic, I'll add that I already have a perfectly acceptable heir in my brother's son. Furthermore, I have no intention of adhering to custom, now or in future, by shackling myself to a wife for the sole purpose of begetting a legal heir of my own body."<br>As Stephen came to the end of that blunt speech, he watched her expression change from surprise to amused bafflement. Her next remark clarified the reason for her obvious quandary: "If not to beget an heir, what other possible reason could there be for a man such as you to wed at all?"<br>Stephen's disinterested shrug and brief smile dismissed all the other usual reasons for marriage as trivial, absurd, or imaginary. "For a man such as I," he replied with a mild amusement that failed to disguise his genuine contempt for the twin farces of wedded bliss and the sanctity of marriage -- two illusions that flourished even in the brittle, sophisticated social world he inhabited, "there does not seem to be a single compelling reason to commit matrimony."<br>Helene studied him intently, her face alight with curiosity, caution, and the dawning of understanding. "I always wondered why you didn't marry Emily Lathrop. In addition to her acclaimed face and figure, she is also one of the few women in England who actually possesses the requirements of birth and breeding in enough abundance to make her worthy of marrying into the Westmoreland family and of producing your heir. Everyone knows you fought a duel with her husband because of her, yet you didn't kill him, nor did you marry her a year later, after old Lord Lathrop finally keeled over and cocked up his toes."<br>His brows rose in amusement at her use of irreverent slang for Lathrop's death, but his attitude toward the duel was as casual and matter-of-fact as her own. "Lathrop got some maggot into his head about defending Emily's honor and putting a stop to all the rumors about her, by challenging one of her alleged lovers to a duel. I will never understand why the poor old man chose me from amongst a legion of viable candidates."<br>"Whatever method he used, it's obvious age had addled his mind."<br>Stephen eyed her curiously. "Why do you say that?"<br>"Because your skill with pistols, and your skill on the duelling field, are both rather legendary."<br>"Any child of ten could have won a duel with Lathrop," Stephen said, ignoring her praise of his abilities. "He was so old and frail he couldn't steady his own pistol or hold it level. He had to use both hands."<br>"And so you let him leave Rockham Green unscathed?"<br>Stephen nodded. "I felt it would be impolite of me to kill him, under the circumstances."<br>"Considering that he forced the duel on you in the first place, by calling you out in front of witnesses, it was very kind of you to pretend to miss your shot, in order to spare his pride."<br>"I did not pretend to miss my shot, Helene," he informed her, and then he pointedly added, "I deloped."<br>To delope constituted an apology and therefore implied an admission of guilt. Thinking he might have some other explanation for standing twenty paces from his opponent and deliberately firing high into the air instead of at Lord Lathrop, she said slowly, "Are you saying you really <i>were</i> Emily Lathrop's lover? You were actually <i>guilty?"</i><br>"As sin," Stephen averred flatly.<br>"May I ask you one more question, my lord?"<br>"You can <i>ask</i> it," he specified, struggling to hide his mounting impatience with her unprecedented and unwelcome preoccupation with his private life.<br>In a rare show of feminine uncertainty, she glanced away as if to gather her courage, then she looked up at him with an embarrassed, seductive smile that he might have found irresistible had it not been immediately followed by a line of questioning so outrageous that it violated even his own lax standards of acceptable decorum between the sexes. "What was it about Emily Lathrop that drew you to her bed?"<br>His instant aversion to that question was completely eclipsed by his negative reaction to her next. "I mean, was there anything she did with you -- or <i>for</i> you -- or <i>to</i> you, that I do not do when we're in bed together?"<br>"As a matter of fact," he replied in a lazy drawl, "there was one thing Emily did that I particularly liked."<br>In her eagerness to discover another woman's secret, Helene overlooked the sarcasm edging his voice. "What did she do that you particularly liked?"<br>His gaze dropped suggestively to her mouth. "Shall I show you?" he asked, and when she nodded, he bent over her, bracing his hands on either side of her pillow so that his waist and hips were only inches above her head. "You're absolutely certain you wish to take part in a demonstration?" he asked in a deliberately seductive whisper.<br>Her emphatic nod was playful and inviting enough to take the edge off his annoyance, leaving him caught somewhere between amusement and exasperation. "Show me what she did that you particularly liked," she whispered, sliding her hands up his forearms.<br>Stephen showed her by putting his right hand firmly over her mouth, startling her with a "demonstration" that matched his smiling explanation: "She refrained from asking me questions like yours about <i>you</i> or anyone else, and that is what I <i>particularly</i> liked."<br>She gazed back at him, her blue eyes wide with frustrated chagrin, but this time she did not fail to notice the implacable warning in his deceptively mild voice.<br>"Do we have an understanding, my inquisitive beauty?"<br>She nodded, then boldly attempted to tip the balance of power into her favor by delicately running her tongue across his palm.<br>Stephen chuckled at her ploy and moved his hand, but he was no longer in the mood for sexual play or for conversation, and so he pressed a brief kiss on her forehead and left.<br>Outside, a wet gray fog blanketed the night, broken only by the faint eerie glow of lamplights along the street. Stephen took the reins from the relieved footman and spoke soothingly to the young pair of matched chestnuts who were stamping their hooves and tossing their manes. It was the first time they had been driven in the city, and as Stephen loosened the reins to let them move into a trot, he noted that the curb horse was extremely skittish in the fog. Everything unnerved the animal, from the sound of his own hooves clattering on the cobbled streets to the shadows beneath the streetlamps. When a door slammed off to the left, he shied, then tried to break into a run. Stephen automatically tightened the reins, and turned the carriage down Middleberry Street. The horses were moving at a fast trot and seemed to be settling down a bit. Suddenly an alley cat screamed and bolted off a fruit cart, sending an avalanche of apples rumbling into the street. At the same time the door of a pub was flung open, splashing light into the street. Pandemonium broke loose: dogs howled, the horses slipped and bolted frantically, and a dark figure staggred out of the pub, disappeared between two carriages drawn up at the curb...and then materialized directly in front of Stephen's carriage.<br>Stephen's warning shout came too late.<br>Copyright � 1994 by Eagle Syndication, Inc.</p><h2>Rolling Thunder</h2><p>Lines of bikes are miles long,<br><br>shining, half a million strong.<br><br>Rumbling, grumbling, engines roar.<br><br>Peace signs.

It was definitely a pigeon.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was also very definitely sitting on Danny&#x2019;s head.</p><p>&#x201c;Technically it&#x2019;s a rock dove,&#x201d; said Wendell the iguana helpfully. &#x201c;<i>Columba livia,</i> to be exact. They nest on cliffs, and when people started building skyscrapers, the pigeons starting nesting on those too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wendell,&#x201d; said Danny.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Why</i> is there a pigeon on my head?&#x201d;</p><p>Wendell rubbed his chin. &#x201c;Good question. Maybe it thought your head looked like the Empire State Building?&#x201d;</p><p>Danny Dragonbreath had enough problems. He was the only dragon in a school full of frogs and lizards, he couldn&#x2019;t breathe fire very well, and he was pretty sure that he had just flunked a pop quiz. Having a pigeon on his head was one problem too many.</p><p>He tried to pull it off. It latched on to his scales with its feet and made happy pigeon noises.</p><p>&#x201c;I think it likes you,&#x201d; said Wendell.</p><p>&#x201c;Get it off!&#x201d; yelled Danny. &#x201c;Lunch will be over any minute now! I can&#x2019;t go back to class with a pigeon on my head!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Errr . . . tell everyone it&#x2019;s a hat?&#x201d; Wendell flapped his hands at the pigeon. &#x201c;Go on, shoo!&#x201d;</p><p>The two-minute bell rang in the distance.</p><p>The pigeon finally got the hint and took off, flapping. &#x201c;Coo!&#x201d; it said reproachfully.</p><p>&#x201c;That was weird,&#x201d; said Wendell. &#x201c;Even by your standards.&#x201d;</p><p>Danny rubbed his head and grumbled.</p><p>They were nearly back to class when a familiar shape loomed in front of them.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, Dorkbreath,&#x201d; said Big Eddy.</p><p>&#x201c;Big Eddy,&#x201d; said Danny.</p><p>He poked Danny in the chest with one finger. Since Big Eddy was a Komodo dragon, his fingers were the size of bratwurst. &#x201c;You a <i>dancer</i> now, Dorkbreath? You gonna invent a new dance and put a video on the Internet so we can all laugh at you?&#x201d;</p><p>He poked Danny again.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re gonna be late . . .&#x201d; mumbled Wendell, trying to slide sideways around Big Eddy.</p><p>Danny rolled his eyes. &#x201c;<i>Obviously</i> there was a pigeon on my head. You need to pay closer attention.&#x201d;</p><p>Big Eddy blinked.</p><p>The school bully was very large but not very bright. It was sometimes possible to stun him by uttering something so unexpected that he took a few minutes to process it.</p><p>&#x201c;Pigeon?&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a new thing. Head-pigeoning. I thought you would have heard of it by now.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Head-pigeoning?&#x201d;</p><p>The bell rang again.</p><p>&#x201c;Gotta go!&#x201d; said Danny, and ran off to find out how badly he&#x2019;d flunked the quiz.</p><p>Danny and Wendell got off at the bus stop near Danny&#x2019;s house. The dragon got about five steps before something warm and feathery settled on his head.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the pigeon again, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d; said Danny grimly.</p><p>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; said Wendell. &#x201c;Or <i>a</i> pigeon, anyway. I suppose there could be more than one.&#x201d;</p><p>This was not reassuring.</p><p>Danny hunched his shoulders and stalked down the sidewalk. There was probably no point in trying to get it off until he was close enough to the house to duck inside.</p><p>A passing car slowed down to stare at him.</p><p>Danny was no stranger to having cars slow down to stare at him, but usually it was because he was doing something awesome like standing on a rooftop wearing a cape or building a giant snow platypus. Merely having a pigeon on his head didn&#x2019;t qualify.</p><p>&#x201c;Wendell! Hey, Wendell!&#x201d;</p><p>Wendell slowed down. Danny sighed and turned around.</p><p>Christiana Vanderpool, the only person in school nerdier than Wendell, ran down the sidewalk after them. &#x201c;Hey, Wendell, can I borrow that book on the Burgess Shale?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sure!&#x201d; said Wendell.</p><p>&#x201c;The what?&#x201d; said Danny.</p><p>&#x201c;Very old rock. Had lots of squirmy things fossilized in it. Stuff nobody&#x2019;s ever seen on earth before. Or since, for that matter.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Did you know there&#x2019;s a pigeon on your head?&#x201d;</p><p><i>&#x201c;Columba livia&#x2014;&#x201d;</i></p><p>&#x201c;Yeah yeah, so Wendell said.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Quite a nice specimen,&#x201d; said Christiana. She stood on her tiptoes and scratched the pigeon&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;<i>Who&#x2019;s </i>a good widdle pigeon, den?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You want the pigeon? It&#x2019;s yours. You can teach it to fly mazes or something.&#x201d; Danny tried to pry the pigeon off his head again. It flapped hard a few times, then snuggled down against his scales.</p><p>&#x201c;I think it likes you,&#x201d; said Christiana.</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, it sat on my head at recess too.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is <i>this </i>why Big Eddy was wandering around with bread crumbs on his head? I was wondering about that, but I didn&#x2019;t want to ask him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Did it work?&#x201d; asked Wendell.</p><p>&#x201c;Well . . . sort of. . . .&#x201d; She scratched her head. &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t get pigeons, he got starlings. A bunch of them. And you know what they do when they get excited . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Squawk?&#x201d; guessed Danny.</p><p>She gave him a look. &#x201c;No. They poop.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The pigeon followed Danny home from school,&#x201d; said Wendell proudly. &#x201c;And it hasn&#x2019;t pooped on him <i>once.</i>&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe it&#x2019;s a homing pigeon,&#x201d; said Christiana. &#x201c;Although they usually go to places, not to people. There are reports of homing pigeons flying thousands of miles with important messages. They navigate by magnetic fields.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s a good thought,&#x201d; said Wendell. &#x201c;We should check it for messages.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why would someone send a homing pigeon after me?&#x201d; asked Danny. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know any pigeons.&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Unless . . . there&#x2019;s an evil genius about to take over the world using pigeons, and this one&#x2019;s just the first, and pretty soon <i>everybody</i> will have a pigeon on their head and then we&#x2019;ll be helpless when he deploys his orbital moon laser!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Or<i> her</i> orbital moon laser,&#x201d; said Christiana. &#x201c;I hear more women are breaking into mad science all the time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a note tied to its leg,&#x201d; said Christiana. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, little guy, let me just untie this . . . <i>there&#x2019;s</i> a good pigeon . . .&#x201d;</p><p>The note was tiny and rolled up like a scroll. She smoothed it out and handed it to Danny. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s addressed to you.&#x201d;</p><p>Danny scratched his head, moving the pigeon slightly. &#x201c;Okay . . .&#x201d;</p></p><h2>God Behaving Badly: Is the God of the Old Testament Angry, Sexist and Racist?</h2><p>God has a bad reputation. Many think of God as wrathful and angry, smiting people right and left for no apparent reason. The Old Testament in particular seems at times to portray God as capricious and malevolent, wiping out armies and nations, punishing enemies with extreme prejudice. But wait. The story is more complicated than that. Alongside troubling passages of God&#39;s punishment and judgment are pictures of God&#39;s love, forgiveness, goodness and slowness to anger. How do we make sense of the seeming contradiction? Can God be trusted or not? David Lamb unpacks the complexity of the Old Testament to explore the character of God. He provides historical and cultural background to shed light on problematic passages and to bring underlying themes to the fore. Without minimizing the sometimes harsh realities of the biblical record, Lamb assembles an overall portrait that gives coherence to our understanding of God in both the Old and New Testaments.</p><p><strong>David T. Lamb</strong> (D.Phil., Oxford) is associate professor of Old Testament at Biblical Theological Seminary in Hatfield, Pennsylvania. He previously worked in campus ministry with InterVarsity Christian Fellowship and has taught extensively in various crosscultural contexts. He is the author of <em>Righteous Jehu and His Evil Heirs</em> (Oxford)."I highly recommend this book to students, laypeople, and pastors as an excellent introduction to how to understand the Old Testament portrait of God in light of the questions raised by new atheists and struggling Christians." (George P. Wood, Enrichment, Spring 2012)<br><br>"What is the book about? In a nutshell, it addresses some of the most common problematic stereotypes of the OT God: angry, sexist, racist, violent, legalistic, rigid, and distant. In about 200 pages, Lamb treats these topics in a well-informed, accessible, and humorous way. The book is very persuasive overall, easy to read, and extremely well-written. . . . So, for me, <em>God Behaving Badly</em> is the perfect textbook." (Nijay Gupta, www.nijaygupta.wordpress.com, December 2011)<br><br>"Lamb encourages readers to prove disturbing passages with an open mind, read feminist theologians, and engage in prayerful conversation. . . . This book will challenge, comfort, and provoke reflection." (Publishers Weekly, May 9, 2011)<br><br>"Let's face it: God gets a lot of bad press--it can be a little embarrassing. So even the title of Dave Lamb's book gave me hope. Dave gives honest voice and deliberate attention to some of the most troublesome questions humans have ever asked, and brings not only answers but develops our view of God too. The most thrilling thing about this book is that I can recommend it to both the faithful and the skittish, to friends and students and people who think about God and aren't sure what to think." (Alison Siewert, New Ministry Developer, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), and editor, Worship Team Handbook)<br><br>"In many of our African American churches we frequently recite the refrain, 'God is good all the time and all the time God is good.' <em>God Behaving Badly</em> is an engaging, thoughtful, witty and helpful book that can give all of us Christian readers a bit more confidence when reciting that refrain. David Lamb gives sound guidance for understanding a difficult topic. Lamb offers an apologetic for not only believing in God but also believing that God is good--even as he is portrayed in the Old Testament. Professor Lamb's scholarship is sound and his sense of humor had me laughing out loud. Not many theology books can do that! I'm going to use this book in class and enthusiastically recommend it to my congregants!" (Rev. Dennis R. Edwards, Ph.D., pastor, Peace Fellowship Church, Washington, DC)<br><br>"Dave Lamb's book is a popular apologetic that answers the question, 'Is the God of the Old Testament angry, sexist and racist?' He prefaces his answers with a solid biblical interpretation guideline. The author emphatically states, 'When we approach Scripture, we must take the context seriously.' Dave really does that! The word <em>context</em> appears 59 times, scattered throughout the book. Dave's solid contextual analysis of passages--which might appear to say, Yes, Yes, Yes in answer to the question about God's anger, his view of gender and his view of races--was a highlight for me. Dave's unraveling of many problematic texts in terms of contextual analysis is superb. In addition, his many, many masterful word studies shed light on his contextual analyses. Dave writes with winsome humor. He loves the Old Testament, and you can tell that as you read the popularly written, academically sound, easy-to-read flow of material in each chapter. After reading Dave's book, I am sure you will appreciate that Dave views the God of the Old Testament and the God of the New Testament as one." (Bobby Clinton, professor of leadership, School of Intercultural Studies at Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"It has been said that if you love something long enough it reveals itself to you--that love is a hermeneutical key to unlocking the mysteries of life itself. This is especially true for the Bible and the God of the Bible, for God is love and can only be truly known in love. David Lamb has loved his way into understanding Yahweh more fully; subsequently he can lovingly help us to 'see' and experience God in new and revealing ways." (Alan Hirsch, author of The Forgotten Ways)<br><br>"This is a book which not only should be read by those into apologetics, but read by all Christians in our churches. It is striking right at the heart of one of the most pressing questions being asked today and we cannot ignore this. <em>God Behaving Badly</em> is an extremely helpful book in wrestling with these very difficult questions in a winsome, biblical and readable way. If you are at all missionally living in our culture and aware of the questions being asked and challenges to Christianity, then you really cannot help but read this book!" (Dan Kimball, author of They Like Jesus But Not The Church)<br><br>"David Lamb faces up to all the questions that most often trouble people about the God of the Old Testament. Written in a winsome and engaging way, this book is going to help many who wonder if the God of the Old Testament is indeed the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ." (John Goldingay, David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"I will require my college students to read this book. I became sensitive to the 'God questions' in the Bible because students asked me questions that came straight from troubled hearts. This book is written for students and speaks with wit and wisdom to the questions they have." (Scot McKnight, Karl A.

So, if your teenager or young adult is in the midst of crisis due to self-injury, mental illness, depression, bullying, or destructive choices, you probably feel broken, powerless, and isolated.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dena Yohe wants you to know you are not alone. You are not a bad parent. And you are going to be okay.<br>&nbsp;<br>Dena has been where you are. In <i>You Are Not Alone, </i>she speaks from experience as she offers healthy ways to maintain your other relationships, suggestions for responding to friends who don&#x2019;t understand, and ideas for keeping up your emotional and spiritual well-being when your world feels as if it&#x2019;s crashing down.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is possible to find purpose in your pain, joy beyond your fear, and hope for every tomorrow. <br>&nbsp;<br><i>Includes prayers, exercises, websites, and other helpful resources.</i></p><p><b>Dena Yohe </b>has been a social worker, pastor's wife, and&nbsp;Cru staff member. She is the mother of Renee�Yohe Yohe, the suicidal, addicted, depressed, self-harming girl whose situation led friends to start the well-known nonprofit To Write Love on Her Arms. Renee&#x2019;s life was also portrayed in the 2015 Sony Pictures release by the same name. Dena is an avid blogger. She and her husband, Tom, have three grown children, enjoy being grandparents, and live in Orlando, Florida.Everyone who knew Rene� thought she was doing well. But danger lurks around every corner for recovering addicts who also struggle with mental illness and self-injury, especially in the early years of sobriety. This was my twenty-two-year-old daughter&#x2019;s situation. By 2009 Rene� had crisscrossed the country for three years to share her inspirational message of hope, but she had never traveled alone&#x2014;until now. Rene� flew to a new city, then drove herself to a small university for a speaking engagement. That evening she, a gifted communicator, spoke to a group of students and professors. Audiences found her beauty, candor, and eloquence captivating. Amazed at how much she had overcome, many stayed after the presentation to talk with her personally.&nbsp;<br><br> &#x201c;May I have your autograph?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Would you take a picture with me?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re my hero. Your story saved my life.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br> It was both a blessing and a burden.&nbsp;<br><br> Since Rene�&#x2019;s story had gone around the world and inspired millions (via a nonprofit called To Write Love on Her Arms), this had become a common scene. But she never got used to it. For many who struggle with the same issues&#x2014;addiction, cutting, mental illness, suicidal tendencies, and the sexual trauma that often accompanies a dangerous lifestyle&#x2014;Rene� was a significant source of encouragement. To some, she became an idol.<br><br> In her pain-filled story, both young and old found what they needed to continue walking out their own stories: hope and courage. Hope to believe things could get better, and courage never to give up fighting for their lives.<br><br> On this night Rene� told her moving story one more time, then hung out afterward to talk with students and faculty as long as she could bear it. Unbeknownst to anyone, her recovery was unraveling. Life had been draining out without being replenished. The battle was raging and she was losing.<br><br> My mother heart was about to be crushed&#x2014;again.<br><br> <b>Shattered Peace</b><br><br>The phone rang in our bedroom at 3:00 a.m., piercing the peaceful silence of the night. Adrenaline pumped through my veins. Phone calls after midnight were never a good thing.<br><br> My husband, Tom, sleepily answered the phone while I struggled to catch my breath. I tried not to assume the worst, yet somehow I knew. A sense of dread welled within me.<br><br> <i> We&#x2019;ve been here before. I don&#x2019;t want to go back. I don&#x2019;t think I can do this again. It was brutal the first time. I&#x2019;m not ready, Lord.<br></i><br> No one ever is.<br><br> &#x201c;Hello? Rene�, is that you?&#x201d; I heard Tom say.<br><br> <i> I knew it. I wish I had been wrong. </i>Years of experience had trained my ear to recognize the sound of distress in my husband&#x2019;s voice.<br><br> &#x201c;What happened, honey? Where are you? What?&#x201d; Panic rose in his voice.<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t understand you. Slow down. Please, Rene�, calm down. Take&nbsp;some deep breaths. You can do it. Panicking won&#x2019;t help. Now, what did you say?&#x201d;<br><br> There was an uncomfortable pause. I hurried to Tom&#x2019;s side and sat beside him so I could hear both sides of the conversation.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m scared, Daddy.&#x201d; <i>If she&#x2019;s afraid, it must be bad, </i>I thought.<br><br> &#x201c;What are you afraid of, honey?&#x201d; he asked calmly.<br><br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t get the bleeding to stop!&#x201d;<br> <i> <br> Oh, God, no. </i>I covered my mouth to keep from screaming.<br><br> &#x201c;And I&#x2019;ve been drinking.&#x201d; Crying like a baby, she confessed, &#x201c;Oh, Daddy, I took too many pills.&#x201d;<br><br> Letting out a groan, I doubled over. I felt as if I were sobbing deep in my gut, though nothing audible came out of my mouth. Tom began to pace.<br><br> &#x201c;How many pills did you take, Rene�?&#x201d;<br><br> She whimpered, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know! I don&#x2019;t know!&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d; he asked, on the verge of tears.<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in my hotel room. I&#x2019;m on the floor in the bathroom. I&#x2019;m getting sleepy and there&#x2019;s so much blood.&#x201d; She sounded groggy. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what to do!&#x201d;<br><br> Nausea swept over me. I envisioned blood dripping from scarred arms onto pristine tiles.<br><br> Then, in a voice filled with remorse, she said, &#x201c;Oh, Daddy, I feel so guilty. I don&#x2019;t want to disappoint all those people who look up to me.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, Rene�, I know you don&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Tom reassured. &#x201c;I understand. It&#x2019;s really, really hard. I&#x2019;m so sorry, honey.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Don&#x2019;t worry about them right now. Your life is in danger!<br></i><br> As I listened, salty tears streamed down my cheeks. <i>Her heart is so beautiful. How can she be so broken?<br></i><br> Tom said, &#x201c;But listen to me. No one expected you to be perfect.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Not in the beginning, but maybe I had started to. </i>The realization jolted me.&nbsp;<br> Rene� stammered an unintelligible response.<br><br> Tom continued, &#x201c;You made a mistake, but you&#x2019;re going to get back up and begin again. You&#x2019;re going to be okay. It won&#x2019;t be easy, but you can do it.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Yes. Yes. With God&#x2019;s help, you can. </i>Hearing the confidence in my husband&#x2019;s voice increased mine. All I could hear from the receiver was weeping.<br><br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve come so far, Rene�. Remember, the only way you can fail is to give up.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t give up, Daddy. I won&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br> I wanted to believe her with all my heart.<br><br> &#x201c;Okay, now you&#x2019;ve got to listen to me closely and do exactly what I tell you. Don&#x2019;t hang up, but put your cell phone down. Grab some towels and wrap up your arms. Then go find the hotel phone in your room and call the front desk. Tell them it&#x2019;s an emergency. Then come right back to your phone in the bathroom. I&#x2019;ll be waiting here for you. Go do it right now.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Oh, my precious princess, hurry back to your phone. Don&#x2019;t go too far away. Daddy and I will be waiting for you.<br></i><br> I rocked back and forth as I sat on the side of our bed in the darkness, shaking and praying.<br> We waited. Not knowing how severe her wounds were or how much danger she was in was pure torture.<br><br> Finally, we heard her weak voice on the phone again. Tom and I let out a collective sigh of relief. Thank God. Help was on the way.<br><br> &#x201c;Good job, sweetheart. I&#x2019;ll stay here with you and keep talking until help arrives. I know you&#x2019;re scared. I understand how much you hate hospitals and psych wards, but your life may be at stake.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Please let them get there in time. </i>We didn&#x2019;t even know the name of the hotel or we would have called for help ourselves. <i>I beg You, God, please save my child.&nbsp;<br></i><br>The next words I heard from Rene� stunned me. &#x201c;Are you mad at me, Daddy? I didn&#x2019;t mean to hurt you and Mom like this.&#x201d;<br><br> <i>Dear God, help me.<br></i><br> Tom shook his head as he almost shouted, emphasizing each word, &#x201c;Oh, no, Rene�! <i>No. </i>We&#x2019;re not mad. We hurt for you. It breaks our hearts to see you in so much pain. We love you. We&#x2019;ll always be here for you!&#x201d;<br><br> Her next question broke me wide open. &#x201c;Can you forgive me? Can you and Mom ever forgive me?&#x201d;<br><br> Falling to his knees, Tom choked, &#x201c;Yes, of course we forgive you, Rene�. You don&#x2019;t <i>ever </i>have to wonder about that. We love you no matter what. We&#x2019;ve always told you there&#x2019;s nothing you could do that would make us love you any more or any less. Nothing will ever change that. Nothing.&#x201d;<br><br> <b>Where It All Began<br></b><br> Ten years before, I noticed the early warning signs of trouble, but I didn&#x2019;t know what they meant&#x2014;or I didn&#x2019;t want to know. When Rene� was twelve she cut herself the first time and began to show symptoms of depression.<br><br> Little did I know she had a problem that would become serious and life threatening.<br><br> Or where this journey would lead.<br><br> Or how much pain it would bring.<br><br> I never could have imagined my daughter&#x2019;s gradual, bumpy recovery from substance abuse and other life-altering issues. I never dreamed her story would be the beginning of an international nonprofit called To Write Love on Her Arms (TWLOHA.com), bringing hope to millions of hurting men and women all over the world.<br><br> Little did I know how her life would change mine.<br><br> But this is not Rene�&#x2019;s story. That is for her to tell. This is my&nbsp;story&#x2014;my perspective as a mother who learned to cope with deep pain, a mom who learned to let go of broken dreams and discover new ones.<br><br> I&#x2019;m not the only one. Countless parents struggle as I have&#x2014;and maybe you have too. We wrestle with the same feelings of denial, shock, disappointment, hurt, anger, fear, and loss. Most of all, we don&#x2019;t want anyone to know. We tend to suffer alone. Lacking support and feeling devoid of hope, we struggle in isolation. And our heartache intensifies.<br><br> <b>Lessening the Heartache</b><br><br> Let&#x2019;s pause for a moment. I want to clarify that this is not a how-to-change-or-fix-your-child book. I have no strategies for guaranteed success. No tips to avoid trouble. I can&#x2019;t tell you how to do that.<br><br> But, parent, you are my focus. Lending you a hand as you try to cope with what might be the most excruciating experiences of your life is the whole point. My goal is to share what helped me, what got me through my darkest days, not knowing how the future would unfold.<br> Friend, fellow parent, when we&#x2019;re willing to be honest, to share our pain with other hurting parents and hear others&#x2019; stories, something unexpected happens. A mysterious exchange takes place. Our discouragement lessens and we find the strength we lacked. We let go of despair and unearth fresh comfort, even community. We find the courage to press on.<br><br> And then, at last, we realize we aren&#x2019;t alone. We can make it&#x2014;together. If I&#x2019;m able to continue my journey without knowing how it will end, then maybe you can too. I may not know the future for my child, but I know Who holds it. I can trust God with all my tomorrows and all of Rene�&#x2019;s. With His help, you and I can find strength and comfort to carry us through our worst times.<br> Again, I can&#x2019;t tell you how to keep your child from making mistakes. But I can encourage and equip you with facts, tools, and resources. I can show you&#x2014;weary, worn-out Mom or Dad&#x2014;you can survive this nightmare. Not only that, I&#x2019;m confident that one day, somehow, you can thrive again.<br><br> &#x201c;Impossible,&#x201d; you say. &#x201c;How can you make such a ludicrous statement?&#x201d; I can tell you how: personal experience, from the core of my belief and the foundation of my hope, based on the words of Jesus, &#x201c;With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible&#x201d; (Matthew 19:26). These are the very things I want to unpack in the chapters that follow.<br><br> It&#x2019;s my prayer that in the pages ahead you&#x2019;ll find new hope and come to believe you can thrive again. I&#x2019;ll share my honest journey, including mistakes made, eye-opening discoveries, and ways to cope that you might not have thought of. You&#x2019;ll read about the truths God showed me and the steps I took that made all the difference. You&#x2019;ll find resources and hear from experts and from fellow parents on a similar path. Rene� will also offer her insights where appropriate, providing a once-troubled child&#x2019;s viewpoint. They&#x2019;re things she wants you to know. I wish I had known them years ago. And each chapter will end with scriptures that helped me. I hope they&#x2019;ll help you too.<br><br> <b>Scripture That Helps</b><br> <i>Lean on, trust in, and be confident in the Lord with all your heart and mind and do not rely on your own insight or understanding. In all your ways know, recognize, and acknowledge Him, and He will direct and make straight and plain your paths.

Meyer Lansky. Bugsy Siegel. Louis Lepke, the self-effacing mastermind of Murder, Inc. Red Levine, the Orthodox hit man who refused to kill on the Sabbath. Abe "Kid Twist" Reles, who looked like a mama's boy but once buried a rival alive. These are just some of the vibrant, vicious characters Rich Cohen's father reminisced about and the author evokes so pungently in Tough Jews.<br><br>Tracing a generation of Jewish gangsters from the candy stores of Brownsville to the clubhouses of the Lower East Side--and, occasionally, to suites at the Waldorf--Cohen creates a densely anecdotal and gruesomely funny history of muscle, moxie, and money. Filled with fixers and schlammers, the squeal of tires and the rattle of gunfire, his book shatters stereotypes as deftly as its subjects once shattered kneecaps.</p><p>When we think gangster, hood, or wiseguy, we often associate these characters with such names as Capone, Luciano, or even Corleone. However, when organized crime reared its ugly head in the late 1920s in Brooklyn, at the foundation were men like Meyer Lansky and Ben Siegel--both Jews. Rich Cohen's romantic account of Jewish gangsters, <i>Tough Jews</i>, brings to life the story of Jewish involvement in the world of organized crime. <p> Cohen persuasively achieves his objective by recounting the stories he heard from his father, who grew up with his friends (including broadcaster Larry King) at the end of the gangster era in Brooklyn, finding heroes in men like "Kid Twist" Reles and Bugsy Goldstein. The intriguing tales Cohen heard, although slightly embellished over time, offer a rare glimpse into a world that can barely be related to today's generation of Jews living in America. These Jews went to prison for committing violent felonies, not white-collar crimes, and got the chair for it. Inspired by their stories, Cohen went on to conduct extensive research through old journals, police records, and court reports to uncover the real stories behind the tales he heard as a boy.</p><p> Cohen warmly discusses his father's fascination with these powerful, charismatic figures, and openly envies his experiences at a time before Jewish people lived under the debilitating shadow of the Holocaust. In addition, Cohen shows compassion for the need of his father's generation to look up to "someone who gives them the illusion of strength." <i>--Jeremy Storey</i></p>Exuberant. . .a vivid narrative. . . .

It's also a book about the destructive power of secrets<b>&#x2014;</b>both family secrets and government secrets. Her father's hidden liquor bottles, the strange cancers in children in the neighborhood, the truth about what&nbsp;they made at Rocky Flats<b>&#x2014;</b>best not to inquire too deeply into any of it. But as Iversen grew older, she began to ask questions and discovered some disturbing realities.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As this memoir unfolds, it reveals itself as a brilliant work of investigative journalism<b>&#x2014;</b>a shocking account of the government's sustained attempt to conceal the effects of the toxic and radioactive waste released by Rocky Flats, and of local residents' vain attempts to seek justice in court. Based on extensive interviews, FBI and EPA documents, and class-action testimony, this taut, beautifully written book promises to have a very long half-life.<br><br>Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader&#x2019;s guide and bonus content</p></p><p><strong>A Q&amp;A with the Author</strong> <br> <strong>Why did you write the book?</strong><br> Rocky Flats was the big secret of my childhood. No one knew what they did at the plant; the rumor in the neighborhood was that they made household cleaning products. We knew nothing about radioactive and toxic contamination. My childhood was also shadowed by the secrecy surrounding my father&#x2019;s alcoholism. My family was very close and loving but also troubled. I wrote the book to learn what really happened at Rocky Flats, to learn everything I could about plutonium pits and nuclear weapons and the crucial role the plant played during and after the Cold War. I also wanted to understand my family and the broader context of what it meant to grow up during the seventies. Secrecy at the level of the community and at the level of family turned out to be a central theme in the book. <p>One of the great ironies of my life is that I spent several years as a travel writer in Europe, looking for good stories to write about, and the biggest story turned out to be&#x2014;quite literally&#x2014;in my own backyard. My family and our neighbors were &#x201c;Cold War warriors,&#x201d; as the plutonium workers themselves were called, but no one told us.</p> <p><strong>How is Rocky Flats a global issue?</strong><br> The 2011 accident at Fukushima, following the tsunami, reminded the world in a terrible way that we cannot ignore the threat of radioactive contamination, whether it comes from nuclear power plants or nuclear weapons sites. The world has experienced many nuclear disasters in recent years, including accidents at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine, the Mayak facility in Russia (the &#x201c;sister&#x201d; plant to Rocky Flats), Rocky Flats in Colorado, and other former nuclear weapons sites around the United States such as Hanford and Fernald. The health effects of short-term, high-level radioactive contamination are fairly well known. What are the health costs of long-term, low-level radioactive exposure? Scientists and physicists continue to debate the topic, but one fact is for sure: there is no safe level of exposure to plutonium. One millionth of a gram, particularly if it is inhaled, can cause cancer.</p> <p>Rocky Flats happened in my backyard, but in a sense it is happening in everyone&#x2019;s back yard. Many of us live in close proximity to former nuclear weapons sites or nuclear power plants with inadequate safety provisions. And, at a time when we are supposed to be decreasing our nuclear arsenal, the U.S. government is talking about producing nuclear triggers again. We need to pay attention.</p> <p><strong>Was it hard to write so intimately about your family?</strong><br> I believe that the most powerful way to tell a story is through personal, everyday experience. Every person on the planet has a story that is both ordinary and extraordinary. My siblings and I swam in the lake behind our house and rode our horses in the fields. We had, in many ways, a blessed childhood. And this kind of experience is one that many readers will share. What makes our story unique is that it connects, in ways that we never anticipated, to a broader historical and political narrative. The story of the 1969 fire at Rocky Flats&#x2014;which very nearly destroyed the entire metro Denver area&#x2014;is all the more powerful when you realize that my family was having a very pleasant Mother&#x2019;s Day brunch at a nearby restaurant. We had no idea what was going on&#x2014;and neither did other Coloradoans. It was only by including the experiences of me, my family, my neighbors, and my coworkers at Rocky Flats that I could truly bring the story to life. It was indeed a challenge to write intimately about things that, as a family, we were never supposed to discuss, including my father&#x2019;s drinking. And yet the end result was a tremendous sense of clarity and understanding.</p> <p><strong>What surprised you most during your research for the book?</strong><br> I was surprised, and continue to be surprised, by the secrecy surrounding this very dramatic story. What happened at Rocky Flats, during the Cold War and up to the present moment, is crucially important not only to Colorado but to the entire country. But so much of the story has been hidden over the years, and now it is in danger of being forgotten. Recently I stayed at a hotel just a few miles from the Rocky Flats site, and the young man at the front desk had grown up in Colorado. He&#x2019;d never heard of Rocky Flats. Of those people who do know the story--or part of it--many believe that Rocky Flats is old history, that it&#x2019;s irrelevant and insignificant. They believe the land is safe and the story is over. After all, you can&#x2019;t see or smell plutonium.</p> <p>Yet we cannot forget the story of Rocky Flats. The effects will linger far into the future. There were many other surprises too. During my research, I was shocked to discover how many tons of MUF, or &#x201c;Missing Unaccounted For&#x201d; plutonium, was missing, even to the present day. And the history of the 1989 FBI raid on Rocky Flats is fascinating. I believe it&#x2019;s the only time in the history of the United States that two government agencies--the FBI and the EPA--have raided another agency, the Department of Energy.</p> <p></p><p><b>KRISTEN IVERSEN</b> grew up in Arvada, Colorado, near the Rocky Flats nuclear weaponry facility.&nbsp;She is director of the MFA program in creative writing at the University of Memphis.&nbsp;Visit her website at KristenIversen.com.</p></p><h2>How Reason Can Lead to God: A Philosopher&#39;s Bridge to Faith</h2><p><strong>Do you seek the truth?</strong> Do you value reason, science, and independent thinking? Are you skeptical of beliefs that people maintain merely "on faith," yet you remain interested in the big questions of life? Do you hope there could be a greater purpose to the universe, if only that were realistic? If so, then philosopher Joshua Rasmussen can encourage you in your journey. Beginning with his own story of losing faith and the belief in any ultimate purpose in life, he then builds a bridge to a series of universal truths about ultimate reality. Using only the instruments of reason and common experience, Rasmussen constructs a pathway&#x2015;step by step, brick by brick&#x2015;that he argues can lead to meaning and, ultimately, a vision of God.</p><p>Joshua Rasmussen (PhD, Notre Dame) is associate professor of philosophy at Azusa Pacific University. He is the author of <em>Defending the Correspondence Theory of Truth</em> and <em>Necessary Existence</em>."Rasmussen's book is destined to be a modern classic. Rasmussen combines simplicity, clarity, and depth to an extraordinary degree, resulting in a book that makes some of the most advanced work in contemporary philosophical theology accessible to the general reader, without sacrificing any logical precision. Rasmussen's style is winsome and engaging, drawing the reader into a thrilling adventure of metaphysical investigation of the existence and nature of reality's ultimate foundation." (Robert Koons, professor of philosophy, University of Texas at Austin)<br><br>"This short book contains a bold, original, and provocative argument that shows how reason can lead a person who is genuinely seeking truth to God. It is written in simple, ordinary language and makes no appeal to authority. Although Rasmussen appeals only to truths that he thinks should be universally accepted, a good deal of the force of the book stems from the personal story of Rasmussen himself; his courage and honesty draw the reader into a similar journey." (C. Stephen Evans, university professor of philosophy and humanities, Baylor University)<br><br>"<em>How Reason Can Lead to God</em> is beautifully written. It is truly exceptional in its clarity and simplicity of prose. While some concepts and arguments may be difficult to digest, the interested reader, up for a rigorous, intellectual workout, will be very richly rewarded. Engaging. Humble. Winsome. Rasmussen strikes just the right tone given the aim(s) of the book. A real gem!" (Kevin Corcoran, professor of philosophy, Calvin College)<br><br>"Rasmussen provides a masterpiece argument for God. He delivers every step in a clear and engaging style. Powerful. Beautiful. Transformative." (William Lane Craig, professor of philosophy, Talbot School of Theology and Houston Baptist University, coauthor of Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview)<br><br>"Rasmussen's superb and unique book provides arguments that are deep, convincing, expressed with admirable clarity, and informed by the very latest in philosophical thought." (Alexander R. Pruss, director of graduate studies and professor, department of philosophy, Baylor University)<br><br>"Professor Rasmussen is a top Christian philosopher, a deeply devoted believer, and a longtime personal friend. He identifies his primary audience as a skeptic who cares about truth, is interested in life's big questions, and believes only what can be supported by reason. And Rasmussen hits the bull's-eye. Along with <em>Mere Christianity</em>, <em>How Reason Can Lead to God</em> is <em>the</em> book to give to such a person. But don't let this aim fool you. This book is a must-read for believers who love philosophy or apologetics. You will learn a ton by reading this book, and by reading it your ability to think will be vastly increased. The flow of Rasmussen's argument for God is developed with such precision and care that, quite frankly, it could not be improved. I am so excited about <em>How Reason Can Lead to God</em> and can't wait to see its impact. So put on your thinking hat, buy it, and study it carefully." (J. P. Moreland, distinguished professor of philosophy, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, author of Scientism and Secularism)<br><br>"<em>How Reason Can Lead to God</em> is an extraordinary book. Rasmussen builds, piece by piece, a bridge from the basic structures of reality to God. This work is meticulously structured. Rasmussen's writing style fits perfectly with the project. He is clear, careful, and patient. He never jumps to a conclusion. He considers objections fairly and engages them thoughtfully. This is simply the best philosophical defense of theism I have read in a long while. But, it is more than a defense of theism. It is a guided tour through the foundations of metaphysics." (Gregory E. Ganssle, professor of philosophy at Biola University, author of Our Deepest Desires: How the Christian Story Fulfills Human Aspiration)<br><br>"A magnificent and prodigious talent as deft in analytic skill as he is adept at uncommon common sense, Joshua Rasmussen has produced a disarming, brilliant, bridge-building book that renders the recondite accessible. It takes readers on a fascinating journey, inviting them to think for themselves, try out his arguments, and come to their own conclusions. He is a remarkable philosopher in the best and old-fashioned sense: respecting his readers; asking vitally important, existentially central questions; rigorously following the evidence where it leads; animated by deep confidence in the revelatory power of reason to show the way. Any genuine seeker of wisdom and truth will find in these pages an eminent kindred spirit and faithful fellow traveler."

Callahan and I were traveling on crash-landed in the Indian Ocean. T.J. was sixteen, and three months into remission from Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma. The pilot&#x2019;s name was Mick, but he died before we hit the water.</p><p>My boyfriend, John, drove me to the airport even though he was third on my list, below my mom and my sister, Sarah, of the people I wanted to take me. We fought the crowd, each of us pulling a large, wheeled suitcase, and I wondered if everyone in Chicago had decided to fly somewhere that day. When we finally reached the US Airways counter, the ticket agent smiled, tagged my luggage, and handed me a boarding pass.</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you, Miss Emerson. I&#x2019;ve checked you all the way through to Mal�. Have a safe trip.&#x201d;</p><p>I slipped the boarding pass into my purse and turned to say good-bye to John. &#x201c;Thanks for driving me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll walk with you, Anna.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t have to,&#x201d; I said, shaking my head.</p><p>He flinched. &#x201c;I want to.&#x201d;</p><p>We shuffled along in silence, following the throng of slow-moving passengers. At the gate John asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s he look like?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Skinny and bald.&#x201d;</p><p>I scanned the crowd and smiled when I spotted T.J. because short brown hair now covered his head. I waved, and he acknowledged me with a nod while the boy sitting next to him elbowed him in the ribs.</p><p>&#x201c;Who&#x2019;s the other kid?&#x201d; John asked.</p><p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s his friend Ben.&#x201d;</p><p>Slouched in their seats, they were dressed in the style favored by most sixteen-year-old boys: long, baggy athletic shorts, T-shirts, and untied tennis shoes. A navy blue backpack sat on the floor at T.J.&#x2019;s feet.</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure this is what you want to do?&#x201d; John asked. He shoved his hands in his back pockets and stared down at the worn airport carpeting.</p><p><i>Well, one of us has to do something</i>. &#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Please don&#x2019;t make any final decisions until you get back.&#x201d;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t point out the irony in his request. &#x201c;I said I wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;</p><p>There was really only one option, though. I just chose to postpone it until the end of the summer.</p><p>John put his arms around my waist and kissed me, several seconds longer than he should have in such a public place. Embarrassed, I pulled away. Out of the corner of my eye, I noticed T.J. and Ben watching it all.</p><p>&#x201c;I love you,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>Resigned, he picked up my carry-on bag and placed the strap on my shoulder. &#x201c;Have a safe flight. Call me when you get there.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d;</p><p>John left and I watched until the crowd enveloped him, then smoothed the front of my skirt and walked over to the boys. They looked down as I approached.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, T.J. You look great. Are you ready to go?&#x201d;</p><p>His brown eyes briefly met mine. &#x201c;Yeah, sure.&#x201d; He had gained weight and his face wasn&#x2019;t as pale. He had braces on his teeth, which I hadn&#x2019;t noticed before, and a small scar on his chin.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi. I&#x2019;m Anna,&#x201d; I said to the boy sitting next to T.J. &#x201c;You must be Ben. How was your party?&#x201d;</p><p>He glanced at T.J., confused. &#x201c;Uh, it was okay.&#x201d;</p><p>I pulled out my cell phone and looked at the time. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be right back, T.J. I want to check on our flight.&#x201d;</p><p>As I walked away I heard Ben say, &#x201c;Dude, your babysitter is smokin&#x2019; hot.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s my tutor, asshole.&#x201d;</p><p>The words rolled off me. I taught at a high school and considered occasional comments from hormone-riddled boys a fairly benign occupational hazard.</p><p>After confirming we were still on schedule, I returned and sat in the empty chair next to T.J. &#x201c;Did Ben leave?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah. His mom got tired of circling the airport. He wouldn&#x2019;t let her come in with us.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Do you want to get something to eat?&#x201d;</p><p>He shook his head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>We sat in awkward silence until it was time to board the plane. T.J. followed me down the narrow aisle to our first-class seats. &#x201c;Do you want the window?&#x201d; I asked.</p><p>T.J. shrugged. &#x201c;Sure. Thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>I stepped to the side and waited until he sat down, then buckled in next to him. He took a portable CD player out of his backpack and put the headphones on, his subtle way of letting me know he wasn&#x2019;t interested in having a conversation. I pulled a book out of my carry-on bag, the pilot lifted off, and we left Chicago behind.</p><p></p>* * *<p></p><p>Things started to go wrong in Germany. It should have taken a little over eighteen hours to fly from Chicago to Mal�&#x2014;the capital city of the Maldives&#x2014;but after mechanical problems and weather delays we ended up spending the rest of the day and half the night at Frankfurt International Airport waiting for the airline to reroute us. T.J. and I sat on hard plastic chairs at 3:00 a.m. after finally being confirmed on the next flight out. He rubbed his eyes.</p><p>I pointed to a row of empty seats. &#x201c;Lie down if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m okay,&#x201d; he said, stifling a yawn.</p><p>&#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t leaving for several hours. You should try to sleep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you tired?&#x201d;</p><p>I was exhausted, but T.J. probably needed the rest more than I did. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. You go ahead.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Absolutely.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; He smiled faintly. &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; He stretched out on the chairs and fell asleep immediately.</p><p>I stared out the window and watched the planes land and take off again, their red lights blinking in the night sky. The frigid air-conditioning raised goose bumps on my arms, and I shivered in my skirt and sleeveless blouse. In a nearby restroom, I changed into the jeans and long-sleeved T-shirt I&#x2019;d packed in my carry-on bag, then bought a cup of coffee. When I sat back down next to T.J., I opened my book and read, waking him three hours later when they called our flight.</p><p>There were more delays after we arrived in Sri Lanka&#x2014;this time due to a shortage of flight crew&#x2014;and by the time we landed at Mal� International Airport in the Maldives, the Callahans&#x2019; summer rental still two hours away by seaplane, I had been awake for thirty hours. My temples throbbed and my eyes, gritty and aching, burned. When they said they had no reservation for us, I blinked back tears.</p><p>&#x201c;But I have the confirmation number,&#x201d; I said to the ticket agent, sliding the scrap of paper across the counter. &#x201c;I updated our reservation before we left Sri Lanka. Two seats. T.J. Callahan and Anna Emerson. Will you please look again?&#x201d;</p><p>The ticket agent checked the computer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Your names are not on the list. The seaplane is full.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What about the next flight?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It will be dark soon. Seaplanes don&#x2019;t fly after sunset.&#x201d; Noticing my stricken expression, he gave me a sympathetic look, tapped his keyboard, and picked up the phone. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>T.J. and I walked to a small gift shop, and I bought two bottles of water. &#x201c;Do you want one?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No thanks.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you put it in your backpack,&#x201d; I said, handing it to him. &#x201c;You might want it later.&#x201d;</p><p>I dug a bottle of Tylenol out of my purse, shook two into my hand, and swallowed them with some water. We sat down on a bench, and I called T.J.&#x2019;s mom, Jane, and told her not to expect us until morning.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a chance they&#x2019;ll find us a flight, but I don&#x2019;t think we&#x2019;ll get out tonight. The seaplanes don&#x2019;t fly after dark, so we may have to spend the night at the airport.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Anna. You must be exhausted,&#x201d; she said.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay, really. We&#x2019;ll be there tomorrow for sure.&#x201d; I covered the phone with my hand. &#x201c;Do you want to talk to your mom?&#x201d; T.J. made a face and shook his head.</p><p>I noticed the ticket agent waving at me. He was smiling. &#x201c;Jane, listen I think we might&#x2014;&#x201d; and then my cell phone dropped the call. I put the phone back in my purse and approached the counter, holding my breath.</p><p>&#x201c;One of the charter pilots can fly you to the island,&#x201d; the ticket agent said. &#x201c;The passengers he was supposed to take are delayed in Sri Lanka and won&#x2019;t get here until tomorrow morning.&#x201d;</p><p>I exhaled and smiled. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s wonderful. Thank you for finding us a flight. I really appreciate it.&#x201d; I tried to call T.J.&#x2019;s parents again, but my cell phone roamed without connecting. Hopefully I&#x2019;d get a signal when we arrived on the island. &#x201c;Ready, T.J.?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said, grabbing his backpack.</p><p>A minibus dropped us off at the air taxi terminal. The agent checked us in at the counter, and we walked outside.</p><p>The Maldives climate reminded me of the steam room at my gym. Immediately, beads of sweat broke out on my forehead and the back of my neck. My jeans and long-sleeved T-shirt trapped the hot, humid air against my skin, and I wished I had changed back into something cooler.</p><p><i>Is it this sweltering all the time?</i></p><p>An airport employee stood on the dock next to a seaplane that bobbed gently on the water&#x2019;s surface. He beckoned to us. When T.J. and I reached him, he opened the door and we ducked our heads and boarded the plane. The pilot was sitting in his seat, and he smiled at us around a mouthful of cheeseburger.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Mick.&#x201d; He finished chewing and swallowed. &#x201c;Hope you don&#x2019;t mind if I finish my dinner.&#x201d; He appeared to be in his late fifties and was so overweight he barely fit in the pilot&#x2019;s seat. He wore cargo shorts and the largest tie-dye T-shirt I had ever seen. His feet were bare. Sweat dotted his upper lip and forehead. He ate the last bite of his cheeseburger and wiped his face with a napkin.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Anna and this is T.J.,&#x201d; I said, smiling and reaching out to shake his hand. &#x201c;Of course we don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d;</p><p>The DHC-6 Twin Otter seated ten and smelled like airplane fuel and mildew. T.J. buckled himself in and stared out the window. I sat down across the aisle from him, shoved my purse and carry-on under the seat, and rubbed my eyes. Mick started the engines. The noise drowned out his voice, but when he turned his head to the side his lips moved as he communicated with someone on his radio headset. He motored away from the dock, picked up speed, and we were airborne.</p><p>I cursed my inability to sleep on airplanes. I&#x2019;d always envied those who passed out the minute the plane took off and didn&#x2019;t wake until the wheels touched down on the runway. I tried to doze, but the sunlight streaming through the seaplane&#x2019;s windows, and my confused body clock, made drifting off impossible. When I gave up and opened my eyes, I caught T.J. staring at me. If the look on his face and the heat on mine was any indication, it embarrassed us both. He turned away, shoved his backpack under his head, and fell asleep a few minutes later.</p><p>Restless, I unbuckled my seat belt and went to ask Mick how long it would be until we landed.</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe another hour or so.&#x201d; He motioned toward the copilot&#x2019;s seat. &#x201c;Sit down if you want.&#x201d;</p><p>I sat down and buckled my seat belt. Shielding my eyes against the sun, I took in the breathtaking view. The sky, cloudless and cobalt above. The Indian Ocean, a swirl of mint green and turquoise blue below.</p><p>Mick rubbed the center of his chest with his fist and reached for a roll of antacids. He put one in his mouth. &#x201c;Heartburn. That&#x2019;s what I get for eating cheeseburgers. But they taste so much better than a damn salad, you know?&#x201d; He laughed, and I nodded my head in agreement.</p><p>&#x201c;So, where are you two from?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Chicago.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What do you do there in Chicago?&#x201d; He popped another antacid into his mouth.</p><p>&#x201c;I teach tenth-grade English.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Ah, summers off.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, not for me. I usually tutor students in the summer.&#x201d; I motioned toward T.J. &#x201c;His parents hired me to help him catch up with his class. He had Hodgkin&#x2019;s lymphoma and he missed a lot of school.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you looked way too young to be his mom.&#x201d;</p><p>I smiled. &#x201c;His parents and sisters flew down a few days ago.&#x201d;</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t able to leave as early as the Callahans because the public high school where I taught let out for summer break a few days later than the private high school T.J. attended. When T.J. found out, he convinced his parents to let him stay behind in Chicago for the weekend and fly down with me instead. Jane Callahan had called to see if it was all right.</p><p>&#x201c;His friend Ben is having a party. He really wants to go. Are you sure you don&#x2019;t mind?&#x201d; she asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It will give us a chance to get to know each other.&#x201d;</p><p>I&#x2019;d only met T.J. once, when I interviewed with his parents. It would take a while for him to warm up to me; it always did when I worked with a new student, especially a teenage boy.</p><p>Mick&#x2019;s voice interrupted my thoughts. &#x201c;How long are you staying?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;For the summer.

Only about two hundred are inhabited, but I expect that to change with all the development going on.

Sweat trickled down the side of his face. His breathing sounded shallow, and he shifted in his seat as if he couldn&#x2019;t find a comfortable position. My uneasy feeling blossomed into sheer panic.</p><p>T.J. woke up. &#x201c;Anna,&#x201d; he said, loud enough for me to hear him over the engines. I turned around. &#x201c;Are we almost there?&#x201d;</p><p>I unbuckled and went back to sit beside T.J. Not wanting to shout, I pulled him closer and said, &#x201c;Listen, I&#x2019;m pretty sure Mick&#x2019;s having a heart attack. He has chest pains and he looks awful, but he&#x2019;s blaming it on heartburn.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What! Are you serious?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded. &#x201c;My dad survived a major heart attack last year, so I know what to watch for.

Rather than the straightforward systems of London, Paris or New York, these networks were used as a propaganda artwork&#x2015;a fusion of sculpture, architecture and art that combined Byzantine, medieval, baroque and constructivist ideas and infused them with the notion that communism would mean a &#x201c;communal luxury&#x201d; for all. Today these astonishing spaces remain the closest realization of a Soviet utopia.<br>Following his bestselling quest for <i>Soviet Bus Stops</i>, Canadian photographer Christopher Herwig has completed a subterranean expedition photographing the stations of each Metro network of the former USSR. From extreme marble and chandelier opulence to brutal futuristic minimalist glory, <i>Soviet Metro Stations</i> documents this wealth of diverse architecture. Along the way Herwig captures the elements that make up this singular Soviet experience: neon, concrete, escalators, signage, mosaics and relief sculptures all combine to build a vivid map of the Soviet Metro.<br><i>Soviet Metro Stations</i> includes an essay by the leading architectural and political writer Owen Hatherley, author of the acclaimed books <i>Landscapes of Communism</i> (2015), <i>Trans-Europe Express</i> (2018) and <i>The Adventures of Owen Hatherley in the Post-Soviet Space</i>.</p></p><p></p><h2>All Over the Map: A Cartographic Odyssey</h2><p><b><b>Created for map lovers by map lovers, this rich book explores the intriguing stories behind maps across history and illuminates how the art of cartography thrives today. </b></b><br><br>In this visually stunning book, award-winning journalists Betsy Mason and Greg Miller--authors of the National Geographic cartography blog "All Over the Map"--explore the intriguing stories behind maps from a wide variety of cultures, civilizations, and time periods.

Keep up with him by visiting SpenceQuinn.com.Paw and Order <br> <br>ONE<br> <br>We blasted out of bayou country, Bernie behind the wheel, me in the shotgun seat. Our ride&#x2019;s a real old Porsche, the oldest we&#x2019;ve had in our whole career. The last one got blown up; the one before that went off a cliff. And who can remember the one before that? Not me, amigo, except for how loud train whistles turn out to be from up real close. The point is, old Porsches are how we roll at the Little Detective Agency, just one of the things that makes us so successful, leaving out the finances part, where we&#x2019;ve run into some hiccups I won&#x2019;t go into now. And don&#x2019;t get me started on hiccups, which is the annoying thing about them, namely that you can&#x2019;t stop. What else do you need to know? Bernie&#x2019;s last name is Little, which is how come we&#x2019;re the Little Detective Agency. I&#x2019;m Chet, pure and simple.<br> <br>We came to a crossroads with a roadhouse on one corner. Bernie slowed down and read the sign: &#x201c;Ti-Pierre&#x2019;s Cajun BBQ.&#x201d; No surprise there: for some time now, barbecue had been in the air, impossible to miss. Bernie tilted up his face&#x2014;no need to describe his face, the best human face in the world&#x2014;and took a sniff. &#x201c;I can almost smell it,&#x201d; he said. Yes, the best human face, not at all like those tiny-nosed human faces you see so often. Bernie had a nose that looked capable of doing big things. So why didn&#x2019;t it? I turned to him, gave that nose a good long look. He gave me a good long look back.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s on your mind, big guy?&#x201d; he said. Then he smiled. &#x201c;I got it&#x2014;you&#x2019;re up for one last taste of the local grub before we head for home.&#x201d;<br> <br>No! That wasn&#x2019;t it at all! Bernie laughed and gave me a nice pat, scratched the spot between my ears where I can&#x2019;t get to. And just like that, one last taste of the local grub was all alone in my mind, whatever had been there before completely gone. I couldn&#x2019;t have been happier, which is how I like to operate.<br> <br>We pulled into the parking lot at Ti-Pierre&#x2019;s Cajun BBQ. I was just noticing all the bikes in the lot, the big kind that bikers like, when the phone buzzed. Bernie hit speaker.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bernie? You called?&#x201d; Hey! It was Suzie. Hadn&#x2019;t heard her voice in way too long, although it usually sounded warmer than this. Suzie had been Bernie&#x2019;s girlfriend, back when she&#x2019;d worked for the Valley Tribune, the Valley being where we lived&#x2014;maybe in Arizona, a detail I&#x2019;d picked up quite recently&#x2014;but then she&#x2019;d gone away to take a job with the Washington Post, a no-brainer Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I, um, ah,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;Sorry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re saying you&#x2019;re sorry?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;For what didn&#x2019;t happen,&#x201d; Bernie said. For what didn&#x2019;t happen? This was hard to follow. My mind wandered to a morning not long ago when Suzie had arrived suddenly at the houseboat where Bernie and I had stayed while working the Ralph Boutette case and found Vannah on board. Vannah: a story for another time, but I should probably mention that tiny bikini and how the straps kept slipping no matter what she did. My mind wandered on to something else, namely barbecue, and when it came back, Bernie was saying, &#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. crazy to let silly misunderstandings come between us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How about serious misunderstandings?&#x201d; Suzie said, her voice still pretty cold.<br> <br>&#x201c;Them, too,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>There was a pause, and then Suzie laughed. Soon they were both laughing. I like watching humans laugh when they&#x2019;re on the phone, especially when they laugh their heads off and somehow keep the phone in place the whole time. As for what this conversation was about, you tell me. It went on for some time, and then I put my paw on Bernie&#x2019;s knee, just reminding him about what we were here for, namely barbecue.<br> <br>Bernie glanced at me. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got a feeling Chet&#x2019;s hungry,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;ll be with a capital H,&#x201d; Suzie said, losing me completely. But maybe not Bernie. He laughed again. What fun we were all having! I pressed a little harder with my paw.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;So,&#x201d; said Suzie. After that came a long pause. Then she went on. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s next?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Headed home,&#x201d; Bernie said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Happy trails,&#x201d; said Suzie.<br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�<br><br>We hopped out of the Porsche&#x2014;me actually hopping, Bernie using the door&#x2014;and walked toward Ti-Pierre&#x2019;s Cajun BBQ. They had a deck on one side, so that was where we headed, restaurant decks usually being pretty welcoming to me and my kind. We took the last empty table&#x2014;all the others occupied by biker guys and gals&#x2014;and Bernie ordered: beer for him, water for me, ribs and brisket to share. A biker at the next table leaned toward us.<br> <br>&#x201c;That your Porsche out there?&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie nodded. I&#x2019;d been about to lie down in the shade under the table; instead I sat up nice and straight.<br> <br>The biker leaned a little closer, one of those dudes with a neck thicker than his head, not a look that shows humans at their best, in my opinion. &#x201c;Piece of crap,&#x201d; he said. He had the most interesting breath I&#x2019;d smelled in a long time, a rich mix of onions, garlic, pulled pork, whiskey, pot, cocaine, rotten teeth, and strawberry ice cream.<br> <br>&#x201c;This is America,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome to your opinion.&#x201d;<br> <br>The biker dude turned to the biker gal beside him. Hey! She had the same kind of neck, thicker than her head. Had I ever seen that on a woman before? I was trying to remember when the biker dude spoke in a high little voice. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re welcome to your opinion.&#x201d; The biker gal thought that was funny. So did a bunch of the other bikers, all of them now looking our way. &#x201c;My point exactly, pretty boy,&#x201d; the biker said, now back to his normal voice, rough and loud. &#x201c;This. Is. America.&#x201d;<br> <br>Pretty boy? Was he agreeing with me that Bernie had the best face in the world? I went back and forth on that. Meanwhile, the biker dude was saying, &#x201c;Your piece of crap ride ain&#x2019;t American. Makin&#x2019; you a traitor, as well as a sexual deviator.&#x201d;<br> <br>It got very quiet out on the deck at Ti-Pierre&#x2019;s Cajun BBQ, so when Bernie spoke every word was clear. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re embarrassing yourself,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>It got even quieter. I heard the sounds of chairs being pushed back a bit and feet getting gathered underneath dudes, dudes maybe planning to rise in a hurry.<br> <br>The thick-necked biker&#x2019;s face was real red now and his nostrils had opened up a surprising amount, reminding me of a bull I came across once in a corral I&#x2019;d regretted entering almost immediately. &#x201c;Tell you what,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll give you a choice. I can either beat the shit outta you here and now&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, do that, Ferdie,&#x201d; called someone from another table.<br> <br>&#x201c;&#x2014;or you can put those airy-fairy wheels of yours up against me and my Harley, say from here to the Pont Greve Bridge and back.&#x201d; He took out a fat wad, counted out some bills, and slapped them on our table. &#x201c;A thousand bucks says you lose.&#x201d;<br> <br>Another biker dropped in more money. &#x201c;Make that two grand.&#x201d;<br> <br>And one more biker. &#x201c;Three.&#x201d;<br> <br>Meaning there was a serious pile of money on the table, how much exactly I&#x2019;ll leave to you, since I don&#x2019;t go past two. I had the feeling that we hadn&#x2019;t walked away with a whole lot of green on the Ralph Boutette case, although the details wouldn&#x2019;t come. Something about emergency car repairs? Maybe. But none of that mattered now. All that mattered was us latching on to that pile of money.<br> <br>Bernie leaned back in his chair, looking real relaxed, unlike everyone else on the deck. But that was Bernie! &#x201c;I&#x2019;m mighty tempted, Ferdie,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re too drunk to drive.&#x201d;<br> <br>There&#x2019;s a kind of silent excitement that can spread quickly through a group of humans. It&#x2019;s got some sweat in it, the sour kind, plus a funky part, male and female. I smelled it now, and the fur on the back of my neck rose up. Ferdie got to his feet, and I smelled one more thing: he had a gun in his pocket, recently fired.<br> <br>Ferdie&#x2014;even huger than I&#x2019;d thought, now that I saw him upright&#x2014;gazed down at Bernie like he hated him, which made no sense since they&#x2019;d hardly even met. &#x201c;Willing to bet I&#x2019;m too drunk to beat you to a pulp?&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>Bernie got a distant look in his eyes, the way he does when he&#x2019;s doing his deepest thinking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yellow, huh?&#x201d; said Ferdie, which I didn&#x2019;t get at all, Bernie&#x2019;s skin being tanned and a bit reddish if anything.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s more the syntax,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A little tricky, took me a moment,&#x201d; Bernie said. &#x201c;But sure, I&#x2019;m on. Although why don&#x2019;t I just take the money and spare you the pain?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ferdie roared. More bull than man, but the sound didn&#x2019;t scare me. I&#x2019;d seen enough fighting&#x2014;and done plenty myself&#x2014;to know that when it came to humans, the silent ones are the most dangerous. Did Ferdie flip the table right onto Bernie and come swarming in, throwing heavy roundhouses with his huge arms? Possibly, but I was on my own feet now and facing away from the action, setting up a friendly little boundary, just making it easier for everybody. From behind I heard a thump thump, and maybe one more thump, Ferdie still pounding away, and then came a brief pause followed by a snap that reminded me of wishbones on Thanksgiving&#x2014;my favorite holiday, but no time to go into that now&#x2014;only much louder, and right after that there was a horrible cry of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how to put it? Agony? Not Bernie&#x2019;s of course, but it really did scare me just the same.<br> <br>I turned. Bernie was on his feet&#x2014;the money already tucked into the pocket of his Hawaiian shirt&#x2014;setting the table back up in the proper way. Ferdie lay on the floor kind of&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. how to put it? Writhing? That was as close as I could get. His arm was at an angle you never see. Just the sight of it made a big bearded biker a few tables back puke all over a paper plate stacked with cornbread. I came close to losing my appetite, and in that moment of not concentrating on my job, almost missed Ferdie&#x2019;s biker gal&#x2014;the one with the thick neck, even thicker than his, I now saw: what a time we were having!&#x2014;whipping a little pink-handled gun out from under her bra. Luckily for me&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ve had so much luck in my life, starting with flunking out of K-9 school on the very last day, which was how I met Bernie&#x2014;I can go from just standing around to flying through the air in no time flat, always the best time there is. The next thing I knew I had that little pink popgun in my mouth and the thick-necked biker gal was holding her wrist and calling me names I&#x2019;m sure she didn&#x2019;t mean.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nice work, big guy,&#x201d; Bernie said, taking the gun. A breeze sprang up behind me and after hardly another moment went by, I realized it was my own tail in action. Was I cooking or what?<br> <br>Bernie held up the gun in a delicate kind of way between his finger and thumb. &#x201c;Any objection to me confiscating this? Wouldn&#x2019;t want anyone to get hurt.&#x201d;<br> <br>Judging from the looks on their faces, that didn&#x2019;t go over too well with the bikers. They seemed to be closing in, a dude with one of those teardrop tattoos, like he was always feeling sad, drawing a throwing knife from behind his back.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know what you&#x2019;re thinking,&#x201d; Bernie said, his eyes on no one in particular. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m making a big fuss about nothing. No way such a pipsqueaky thing could be accurate. You&#x2019;re probably right, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Bernie&#x2019;s grip on the gun changed a bit: still kind of loose but now his finger was on the trigger. Crack went the gun, but in a very small way. Then came a clang, and the throwing knife got knocked right out of the teardrop dude&#x2019;s hand and fell to the floor. &#x201c;Gracious me,&#x201d; Bernie said. He stared at the pink-handled gun like he was amazed, then dropped it into his pocket.<br> <br>Things settled down after that. In fact, it turned out the bikers all had somewhere else to be. By the time the waiter appeared with our order, we had the deck to ourselves.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where the hell did everybody go?&#x201d; the waiter said.<br> <br>&#x201c;No one takes time to smell the roses anymore,&#x201d; Bernie told him.<br> <br>Roses? None around that I knew of, and you can trust me on that kind of thing. But the smell of Ti-Pierre&#x2019;s Cajun BBQ was overpowering. The waiter laid a paper plate of brisket at my feet, and I have no memories from that moment until Bernie and I were back in the car.<br> <br>He opened the glove box, popped the little pink-handled gun inside, which was where we normally kept the .38 Special, now on the bottom of the sea for reasons I won&#x2019;t go into. Bernie cranked us up, drove out of the lot and into the crossroads, started to turn, and then stopped. He took his hands off the wheel. There was no traffic, but stopping in the middle of the road? Not our usual MO.<br> <br>Bernie looked my way. &#x201c;Left is west, Chet. West and home. We&#x2019;re westerners, you and me.&#x201d; I was just finding that out now? It sounded important. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s a tide in the affairs of men.&#x201d; This was getting complicated. I started to pant a bit. Bernie&#x2019;s hands settled on the wheel. &#x201c;And east is Suzie.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Full Moon at the Napping House</h2><p>In the wide-awake bed in the full-moon house, everyone is restless!

Mr. Farley went on to write thirty-three other enormously popular books about the Black Stallion and other horses which were published in more than twenty countries. He died in 1989, shortly before the publication of his last novel,&nbsp;<i>The Young Black Stallion</i>, written with his son Steven.Desert Born<br><br>1<br><br>For days the Bedouin band had ridden across the white sands of the Rub al Khali, the Great Central Desert of Arabia, and the steady pounding of the horses' hoofs left a rising cloud of sand behind them. The white-robed figures rode in no particular formation, their long guns resting easily across their thighs, their hands lying only lightly upon them. For the danger of a surprise raid by desert bands had passed . . . ahead lay Addis, on the Red Sea, their destination.<br><br>There were twenty of them, sitting still and straight in their saddles as their horses moved effortlessly across the sand. Each steed's head was held high, his hot coat shining in the sun, and each pulled slightly on his bit as though impatient to break out of the slow canter to which he had been held for so many days. The men, too, were as impatient as the blacks, bays and chestnuts they rode. E . . . yes! It had taken them ten days to cross the Great Desert from the mountain stronghold of their sheikh, Abu Ja Kub ben Ishak, who led them. Ten days! When other trips had taken them but four! Ten days of constant riding, halting during the day only for prayer, to turn toward Mecca with a reverent "La ilaha-'llah: Muhammadum rasula-'llah." And then they would be in the saddle again, their long limbs wrapped about the girths of their mounts.<br><br>And as they rode, if their eyes left the sheikh, astride his giant black stallion, Shetan, it was only to come to rest upon the small black colt who followed doggedly behind the stallion, straining at the lead rope that the sheikh had attached to his own saddle. E . . . yes! It was the young colt with his spindled, tiring legs who was responsible for this long slow march across the Rub al Khali. It was he, as much as his great black stallion of a father, who had caused them to ride with heavy hands upon unslung rifles for so many suns. Only for the possession of the mighty Shetan and his firstborn, worth all the treasures beneath the sun and moon, would other desert tribes dare to challenge the might of the powerful Sheikh Abu Ja Kub ben Ishak! But now the worst of the trek was over, for ahead was Addis and the ship of the sea which would take the young colt to another land.<br><br>Nearing the outskirts of town, the sheikh raised his rifle high in the air, and then slung it over his shoulder; and it came to rest with those of his men.<br><br>They were in formation, riding two abreast as they entered Addis and started down the street that would lead them to the sea and the ship that awaited the son of the black stallion.<br><br>Two boiler-room men climbed the spiraling iron staircase leading up from the bowels of the tramp steamer, Queen of India, as she docked at Addis. Reaching the upper deck, one of them wiped a greasy hand across his perspiring forehead, leaving it streaked with grime. "No better up here, Morgan," he said, as they walked over to the rail and leaned heavily upon it.<br><br>Below on the dock, vendors shouted forth their wares to the multitude of onlookers, freight agents and dock hands who laboriously loaded the varied produce of the desert and farms onto the ship. Camels and donkeys, heavily laden with the wares of vendors, milled with the crowd, superbly unbothered by the high-pitched voices of their owners.<br><br>"Makes me think of the barkers at Coney Island, Harrity," Morgan said nostalgically.<br><br>Harrity didn't answer, for his gaze had left the crowd below and had traveled up the long, narrow, cobblestoned street that led from the pier. Coming toward them was a group of horsemen. And even from this distance he could see that they weren't like the natives below. Heads moving neither to the right nor left, they rode forward, the hoofs of their horses ringing on the stones. Only for a few seconds did Harrity's gaze rest upon the riders' flowing robes; fascinated, he turned his attention to the magnificent animals they rode. He'd heard tales of such horses as these, owned by the feared and little-known Bedouins, supreme rulers of the desert. But in all his years of traveling up the coast of Arabia, he had never seen even one of them until now.<br><br>The horsemen came closer, and Harrity's eyes were drawn to the great black stallion in the lead. Never in the world had he seen a horse like this one, he told himself. This horse towered above the others, his body beautiful to behold. Thunder could roll under those powerful legs, Harrity was sure.<br><br>"Look at that band of Arabs comin' down the street," Harrity heard Morgan say.<br><br>Without taking his eyes from the mighty black, Harrity replied, "Look at the horses, Morgan. Look at them."<br><br>"I'm lookin'. And me who's been to Aqueduct and Belmont, and thought I'd seen the best of 'em."<br><br>"Me, too." Harrity paused, then added, "Get a load of that black stallion in the lead, Morgan. If he isn't one of the finest chunks of horseflesh I've ever seen, I'll eat my hat."<br><br>"Yeah," Morgan replied. "And he's a wild one, all right. See that small head and those eyes? There's fire in those eyes, Harrity. Look! He half-reared. He doesn't want to come any closer to this mob on the dock. That Arab on his back can ride, all right, but he's no match for that devil and he knows it. See, what'd I tell you, Harrity! They're stoppin' out there. He's goin' to get off."<br><br>Suddenly Harrity realized that the shrill voices of the vendors and natives had stilled. The dock was unnaturally quiet. Everybody there had seen the Bedouins.<br><br>A few of the multitude moved toward the band, but stopped when they were still a good distance away. They had moved as though compelled by the fascination of this wild band, and had stopped in fear of it. They knew this group of horsemen, no doubt about that.<br><br>Harrity's eyes were upon the black stallion and the sheikh with the white beard who stood beside him, holding the bridle. The stallion snorted and plunged, and the man let the horse carry him until he had regained control.<br><br>"A black devil," Harrity muttered. "A black, untamed devil."<br><br>"What'dya say?" Morgan asked.<br><br>"That black stallion . . . he's a devil," Harrity repeated.<br><br>"Yeah." There was a slight pause, then Morgan said, "And did ya notice that little black one just behind him? He's tryin' to work up a lather, too."<br><br>Harrity hadn't noticed the young colt, but now he saw him. Standing there on his long legs, the black colt, whom Harrity judged to be about five months old, was being held by one of the Bedouins.<br><br>The colt moved restlessly, trying to pull away from the tribesman who held him close. As though imitating the big black in front of him, he snorted and plunged, throwing his thin forelegs out, striking at the Bedouin. The man moved quickly, avoiding the small hoofs, and then closed in upon the savage head and held him still.<br><br>"Could be father and son from the way they act." Morgan laughed.<br><br>"Yeah," returned Harrity. "Look a lot like each other, too. Coal black they are, except for that small splotch of white on the colt's forehead. Didya notice it, Morgan?"<br><br>"Uh," Morgan grunted. "It looks diamond-shaped from here."</p><h2>Gus (Bright Side)</h2><p>The journey that began in top-rated, best-selling Bright Side, continues ... This is the story of Gus. Losing himself.

Since then, critical race theory has gone on to influence numerous other fields of scholarship, and the Delgado and Stefancic primer has remained an indispensible guide for students and teachers. Delgado and Stefancic have revised the book to include material on key issues such as colorblind jurisprudence, Latino-Critical scholarship, immigration, and the rollback of affirmative action.

His sudden appearance out of complete obscurity, his dramatic interventions in the national history of Israel, his miracles, his departure from the earth in a chariot of fire all serve to that end. He comes in like a tempest, who went out like a whirlwind , says Bishop Hall; the first we hear from him is an oath and a threat . Judgement and mercy were mingled throughout Elijah s astonishing career.<br><br>It is fitting that the lessons which may be drawn from Elijah s ministry should be presented afresh to our generation. History repeats itself. The wickedness and idolatry rampant in Ahab s reign live in our gross 21st century s profanities and corruptions. False prophets occupy large spheres of influence and truths dear to our evangelical forefathers have been downtrodden as the mire in the streets. A.W. Pink clearly felt called to the task of smiting the ungodliness of the age with the rod of God s anger while at the same time encouraging the faithful remnant. With these objects he undertakes the exposition of Elijah s ministry and applies it to the contemporary situation.</p><p>Born in Nottingham, England in 1886, Arthur Walkington Pink was converted to Christ while a spiritualist medium. He briefly attended the Moody Bible Institute in Chicago, Illinois, in 1810, before taking up his first pastorate at Silverton, Colorado. Little-known to the outside world, he pastored other churches in the United States and Australia before finally returning to his homeland in 1934. Settling in Stornoway on the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, there he died almost unnoticed in 1952. By that date, however, the magazine he had started in 1922 Studies in the Scriptures was feeding several of the men who were leading a return to doctrinal Christianity, including Martyn Lloyd-Jones and Douglas Johnson (founder of Inter-Varsity) and, in book form after his death, his writings became very widely read across the world. The Trust publishes his The Sovereignty of God, Gleanings from Paul, Profiting from the Word, The Life of Elijah, and a number of titles which have been translated into Spanish.<br><br>[See also Iain H.

Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. This is the fasting portion only of what was originally published as &#34;Fasting and Sunbathing&#34; (The Hygienic System, Vol 3). Herbert Shelton wrote 40 books over his 60-year career in health education and &#34;natural hygiene.&#34; He supervised over 30,000 fasts of chronically ill and terminal patients, losing only three. Shelton&#39;s teachings on fasting inspired Ghandi as well as such popular authors as Fuhrman, the Diamonds, Mercola and Graham. Harvey and Marilyn Diamond said of Shelton: &#34;A man of astounding intelligence and understanding, Dr. Herbert Shelton was the greatest health oracle of the 20th century.&#34; One of the key tenets of natural hygiene is toxemia + enervation = disease and that symptoms of disease are remedial efforts by the body to return to balance. For example, a fever is instituted by the body to speed metabolic action and kill germs. It is a healing event that should be allowed to run its course, not a dreaded enemy to be suppressed. The best action to take when first becoming ill is to stop eating and rest, which goes contrary to the prevailing advice to take a drug, eat to keep up your strength, and keep on going. When you fast, you are not starving your body of nutrition, because it obtains all the nutrition it needs from its own tissues. But in doing so, the not inconsiderable amount of energy that would have been spent in digestion is now spent in repair of tissues and elimination of toxins. Long fasts of up to three months followed by healthy living practices can (but not always) reverse chronic degenerative diseases such as arthritis, heart disease, colitis, migraines, mental illness, even cancer. (See also Fasting and Eating for Health: A Medical Doctor&#39;s Program for Conquering Disease.) This book will teach you most of what you need to know to conduct a fast of any length. The chapters are: 1. Definition of fasting 2. Fasting among the lower animals 3. Fasting in man 4. Bill-of-fare for the sick 5. Autolysis 6. Fasting is not starving 7. Chemical and organic changes during fasting 8. Repair of organs and tissues during fasting 9. The influence of fasting on growth and regeneration 10.

Mark began his professional career as a massage therapist in 1974. He started teaching massage in 1978 and became a massage school owner and director in 1980. As school director for over 15 years, he developed curriculum, taught classes and continued a part time clinical practice. He served on the boards of a state and a national massage organization in different capacities including sec. of education, sec. of certification and president. In 1996 he earned a bachelor&#39;s degree in Vocational Education with an emphasis on massage therapy from the University of Idaho. A skiing accident in 1990 resulted in a C-6 spinal cord injury that landed Mark in a wheelchair with quadriplegia.

And on a sweltering night in July, a citywide power outage touched off an orgy of looting and arson that led to the largest mass arrest in New York's history. As the turbulent year wore on, the city became absorbed in two epic battles: the fight between Yankee slugger Reggie Jackson and team manager Billy Martin, and the battle between Ed Koch and Mario Cuomo for the city's mayoralty. Buried beneath these parallel conflicts&#x2015;one for the soul of baseball, the other for the soul of the city&#x2015;was the subtext of race. The brash and confident Jackson took every black myth and threw it back in white America's face. Meanwhile, Koch and Cuomo ran bitterly negative campaigns that played upon urbanites' fears of soaring crime and falling municipal budgets.</p><p>These braided stories tell the history of a year that saw the opening of Studio 54, the evolution of punk rock, and the dawning of modern SoHo. As the pragmatist Koch defeated the visionary Cuomo and as Reggie Jackson finally rescued a team racked with dissension,1977 became a year of survival but also of hope.</p><p><i>Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning</i> is a <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year, and the basis of the 2007 ESPN miniseries, starring John Turturro as Billy Martin, Oliver Platt as George Steinbrenner, and Daniel Sunjata as Reggie Jackson.</p></p><p>New York City in 1977 was in the middle of wild upheaval on all fronts, from the hunt for the Son of Sam killer and the citywide blackout to a brutal mayor's race and the rise of punk rock and the zenith of disco. In <i>Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning</i>, journalist Jonathan Mahler revisits all those storylines through another drama, which grabbed tabloid headlines all summer long: the outrageous--and pennant-winning--New York Yankees. The Yankees weren't the greatest baseball team ever assembled--they weren't even the greatest of the era (the talent-laden Cincinnati Reds were superior player for player). But no modern team has earned more type than the "Bronx Zoo" Yanks of the late '70s, thanks in no small part to such characters as meddling owner George Steinbrenner, firebrand manager Billy Martin, and flashy slugger Reggie Jackson.<p> But what more is there to say about a ball club, even one as stormy and successful as the '77 Yanks? Mahler wisely strays out of the dugout and into the chaotic city to give his chronicle breadth and shape. Mahler deftly brings together a host of characters and developments--from doomed old-school catcher Thurman Munson to congressional hellraiser Bella Abzug, from media kingpin Rupert Murdoch to battling politicos Ed Koch and Mario Cuomo, from downtown punks to the glittery decadence of Studio 54. The result is a lively read that will entertain readers who wouldn't know an RBI from CBGB. <i>--Steven Stolder</i></p><b>Jonathan Mahler</b>, a writer for <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, is the author of <i>Ladies and Gentlemen, the Bronx Is Burning </i>and<i> The Challenge: How a Maverick Navy Officer and a Young Law Professor Risked Their Careers to Defend the Constitution--and Won.</i></p><h2>The Pint of No Return: A Mystery (A Sloan Krause Mystery, 2)</h2><p><p><b>Lights.

Not because I was scheming to pick up new readers who stumbled upon my cookbook while searching for Irma S. Rombauer&#x2019;s Joy of Cooking&#x2014;although I admit that wouldn&#x2019;t have been such a terrible thing&#x2014;but really because, as Rombauer imparted in her culinary classic, the process of entertaining and creating delicious food for friends and family is a true joy. And I think that sentiment pertains as much, if not more, to this niche of cooking. There are practical reasons why we clone famous foods, which I will explore later in more detail, such as saving money and duplicating the taste of our favorite dishes with ingredients that we prefer. But the enjoyment we experience when everyone is amazed by the successful re-creation of a delicious dish they thought they could only get in a restaurant or in a package sets this type of cooking apart from any other.</p><p>Over time, as this book evolved from a cookbook with dozens of photographs into one with hundreds of photographs detailing each important step of every recipe, the current title, Step-by-Step, made more sense.</p><p>A NEW LOOK WITH PHOTOS</p><p>I considered using photographs when I began writing my first Top Secret Recipes cookbook in 1987. I studied photography in college&#x2014;even took second place in an L.A. Times photography contest with ten thousand entries while I was in school&#x2014;but at that time I only knew how to process black-and-white photos in the darkroom, and digital cameras were not yet the norm. I wanted to use some art that I could make myself so I decided to illustrate the books with hand-drawn blueprint-style schematics that nicely suited the &#x201c;top secret&#x201d; theme of the books. Over a period of twenty-five years, working on a tiny worn-out drafting table using a combination of stenciling and freehand drawing, I inked a total of 450 blueprints to illustrate the first ten Top Secret Recipes cookbooks. As the years moved on I heard from an increasing number of cookbook buyers and TSR fans who expressed a strong desire for photographs in the cookbooks. I decided it was time to leave the blueprints behind and begin a new look for the Top Secret Recipes cookbooks with step-by-step color photos for each of the recipes.</p><p>This is the first copycat recipes cookbook that guides you with photographs through every important step of the replicating process for each of the brand-name clone dishes. By using the photos along with the instructions, you will now have a clearer understanding of how each part of each recipe is made, virtually guaranteeing that all of these famous dishes come out as intended, so that you will produce delicious and accurate copies of the popular brand-name foods that everyone loves to eat.</p><p>I kept the photos simple and shot many from a first-person perspective, helping you to see exactly how the cooking process should progress in front of you. Since I work alone, it&#x2019;s a little tricky to pose, focus, and shoot this way, but I dig the angle so it&#x2019;s worth the extra effort. When the last ingredient was added, I had shot more than 35,000 photos to get the 1,100+ pics that made it into the book.</p><p>WHAT&#x2019;S IN STEP-BY-STEP</p><p>All 125 recipes in this cookbook are new, never-before-published recipes. Most of them (a total of 75) are formulas that I have not cloned in any of my cookbooks. I call them &#x201c;First-Time Hacks.&#x201d; I chose these recipes from a long list of fan requests that I have compiled over many years and from researching what is popular in today&#x2019;s food business. Some of these items have been big sellers for many years like McDonald&#x2019;s McRib Sandwich (here), The Cheesecake Factory Stuffed Mushrooms (here), Carrabba&#x2019;s Italian Grill Steamed Mussels (here), Gatorade Orange Sports Drink (here), Ben &amp; Jerry&#x2019;s Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough Ice Cream (here), and Legal Sea Foods Legal&#x2019;s Signature Crab Cakes (here). Some of the First-Time Hacks you&#x2019;ll find here are top-selling newer items like Chili&#x2019;s Chipotle Chicken Flatbread (here), McDonald&#x2019;s Premium Sweet Chili Chicken McWrap (here), and Wendy&#x2019;s Pretzel Bacon Cheeseburger (here).</p><p>The other fifty recipes in the book are what I call &#x201c;Improved Hacks.&#x201d; These are some of my most popular classic clone recipes that I have gone back and re-hacked to make much better than my original previously published versions. I tapped into some new techniques and tricks that I&#x2019;ve picked up over the last two and a half decades of cloning foods to make these classic recipes even better culinary carbon copies of their famous brand-name counterparts. For these improved hacks I chose my most popular recipes for which I had discovered new information that helps makes the recipes better, or recipes that needed an update because the original product formulas they clone had been altered. If you like my early version of KFC Cole Slaw, then you&#x2019;ll really like the new hack here where dairy is no longer in the ingredients list. If you&#x2019;re a fan of the Tony Roma&#x2019;s Ribs recipe I published almost twenty years ago, then you&#x2019;re going to be crazy about the new version in this book, which incorporates a restaurant trick I learned to make smoky ribs at home without a smoker (here). The Olive Garden Salad Dressing (here) is better now, as is Wendy&#x2019;s Chili (here), Applebee&#x2019;s Fiesta Lime Chicken (here), and El Pollo Loco Fire-Grilled Chicken (here), just to name a few.</p><p>To make it clear which of the two categories a recipe falls under I have tagged each one with either &#x201c;First-Time Hack&#x201d; or &#x201c;Improved Hack.&#x201d;</p><p>Eight of the recipes included here (some are Improved Hacks and some are First-Time Hacks) were developed from information I gathered on the eight episodes of my CMT TV show Top Secret Recipe. In the show I travel around the country in my food lab on wheels to the headquarters of some of the country&#x2019;s biggest food companies and attempt to re-create their famous products. I am given three days to gather enough information&#x2014;using whatever sneaky means I can muster&#x2014;to re-create a dish that can fool three judges in a blind taste test. Sometimes I am successful, sometimes not so much. Three days is not a lot of time to hack dishes that were developed and perfected by these companies over years of research and development, so the task is a challenging one&#x2014;especially when the judges are often picked by the company whose product I&#x2019;m hacking.</p><p>Every recipe from the show is here: Cinnabon Classic Cinnamon Roll (here), Chili&#x2019;s Grilled Baby Back Ribs (here), Dippin&#x2019; Dots Banana Split Ice Cream (here), Domino&#x2019;s Large Cheese Pizza (here), KFC Original Recipe Fried Chicken (here), Mrs. Fields Chocolate Chip Cookies (here), Outback Steakhouse Bloomin&#x2019; Onion (here), and P.F. Chang&#x2019;s Chicken Lettuce Wraps (here).</p><p>BETTER RECIPES, BETTER RESULTS</p><p>With this book I have made a few changes to the way I write recipes. These tweaks should help give you more consistent and reliable results that closely match the finished products I intend for you to create.</p><p>Because weight is often a more accurate way to measure certain ingredients like flour and powdered sugar, I specify weight measurements for ingredients that are best measured that way. I recommend that you get yourself a kitchen scale and measure ingredients by weight whenever possible. This measuring method will give you more consistent results, especially when baking. If you don&#x2019;t have a kitchen scale, don&#x2019;t worry. I also list the volume measurements for those ingredients.</p><p>Because the amount of salt in salted butter can vary from brand to brand, I am now creating all recipes with unsalted butter. This small change will help give you results that are closer to mine.</p><p>In previous Top Secret Recipes books I often use ingredient shortcuts to make the recipes easy, but this sometimes results in a finished product that could have tasted better if I had used a scratch method. For example, my previous version of Chili&#x2019;s Molten Chocolate Cake (here) called for a boxed cake mix for the cake and bottled fudge for the molten center. In this book I have redesigned the recipe by making the chocolate cake and fudge filling from scratch. It takes a little more time to write recipes this way, but by creating scratch versions of these formulas I can make adjustments in individual ingredients so that the finished product is a better clone of the original recipe. There are several other re-hacks in this book that I have converted to scratch recipes to give you improved results: the Hostess Twinkie (here), which formerly called for a box of pound cake mix, and the Red Lobster Cheddar Bay Biscuits (here), which called for Bisquick baking mix, are a couple other examples. I have also made an effort to create most of the First-Time Hacks in this book with scratch ingredients for more accurate and great-tasting clone recipes.</p><p>I have included an info box at the top of each recipe to give you an idea of the time required for each recipe and the difficulty level. I estimated the time required for the active and inactive preparation of each recipe. The &#x201c;Active Prep&#x201d; time is the hands-on time required to make the recipe, while the &#x201c;Inactive Prep&#x201d; time is the passive time required to make the recipe, such as when ingredients are marinating or something is baking.</p><p>In addition, I have estimated the difficulty of each recipe by tagging the recipe with either &#x201c;Easy,&#x201d; &#x201c;Medium,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Hard.&#x201d; If you are a novice cook I suggest you use only the recipes that are either &#x201c;Easy&#x201d; or &#x201c;Medium&#x201d; difficulty. These recipes make up the bulk of the recipes in this book. There are, however, a handful of recipes here that I consider to be &#x201c;Hard.&#x201d; A little more cooking experience is suggested for these recipes and the time required to make these recipes is considerably longer. You up for the challenge? Don&#x2019;t be scared. They&#x2019;re not impossible recipes&#x2014;just a little harder than the other ones.</p><p>WHY CLONE FAMOUS FOODS?</p><p>It was in 1987 that I received a chain letter in the mail claiming to be the real secret recipe for a Mrs. Fields Chocolate Chip Cookie. It was not, of course. But this chain letter with a mediocre recipe for chocolate chip cookies printed on it was widely popular across the country and caused quite a stir. People who made the recipe and had never tried a Mrs. Fields Cookie assumed that Mrs. Fields Cookies were as ordinary as the cookies produced with the recipe. The chain letter also claimed that the recipe was obtained by a woman who had purchased it at one of the cookie stores for $2.50 but was then charged $250.00 on her credit card for the purchase. This prompted the Mrs. Fields Cookie company to place signs in all their stores disclaiming the recipe as well as the story about the woman&#x2019;s purchase and overcharging. Debbi Fields later wrote about the incident in her book, One Smart Cookie, referring to the situation as &#x201c;The Recipe Problem.&#x201d;</p><p>When I saw the signs pop up in the cookie stores, it struck me that this ridiculous little chain letter must have become very popular&#x2014;and it didn&#x2019;t even make a good cookie! It became obvious to me that America had a fascination with copycat recipes for famous brand-name foods, and a book filled with a bunch of recipes like these might be a winner. For the next five years I spent all my free time learning how to reverse-engineer popular foods, and I started by making a much better version of the Mrs. Fields Chocolate Chip Cookie than the one in the chain letter. Eventually I had created a collection of recipes that duplicated the taste and appearance of iconic American brand-name foods, and I set out to find a publisher for the book.</p><p> That first book, called Top Secret Recipes, came out in 1993 and sold better than expected. I appeared on several popular TV and radio talk shows in the following weeks responding to various questions about my food-hacking process, my favorite cloned recipes, and which secret formulas were the most difficult to reverse-engineer.</p><p>One of the questions that I got most often back then&#x2014;and still today&#x2014;is, &#x201c;Why would anyone want to duplicate a famous food item that they can just go out and buy?&#x201d; In a short radio or TV interview it&#x2019;s hard to hit on all of the reasons why America loves to clone food and why this specialty niche of cooking is more popular today than ever before, but this is the perfect place to give you my full list:</p><p>Cost: It is almost always cheaper to clone these food items at home than it is to purchase the original items at restaurants or in stores. Through cost analysis I have found that re-creating these dishes in your own kitchen costs an average of around half of what the original product will cost you. Cloning famous food at home is a great way to save some coin.</p><p>Customization: With these recipes you have the freedom to customize brand-name dishes to suit your taste preferences and nutritional needs. You may wish to substitute reduced-fat ingredients for those with full fat, such as mayonnaise or sour cream. You may prefer to use organic ingredients, or use wheat buns when sesame seed buns are called for. You may choose to substitute ground turkey for ground beef because you don&#x2019;t eat red meat. You now have the freedom to make these dishes the way you like them and treat yourself to a special version of the item that is not available where the original is sold.</p><p>Discontinuation: Someone once said to me, &#x201c;Why would I ever want to make a Twinkie at home when I can just go out and buy a Twinkie? It&#x2019;s not like they&#x2019;re ever gonna stop selling Twinkies!&#x201d; But in November 2012, that&#x2019;s exactly what happened. Due to a labor dispute, Hostess closed the doors to its baking facilities and we became a Twinkie-less country until the company reopened with new owners in July of the following year. There are gobs of other famous foods that have been discontinued over the years, many of them indefinitely. Having these secret recipes is the only way to enjoy the taste of our favorites long after they are gone.</p><p>Scarcity: In the holiday months of 2008 a memo was sent to all Starbucks stores announcing a shortage of the Pumpkin Cream Cheese Muffins. Demand was so high that year that supplies were dwindling and the chain would run out before the holidays had even arrived! In November 2009 historic amounts of rain closed the plant in Atlanta that makes Eggo Waffles and another Kellogg&#x2019;s plant in Rossville, Tennessee, was closed indefinitely for repairs. These two closures reduced Eggo production by 50 percent and the country was faced with a nationwide shortage of Eggos that left grocery store freezer shelves empty for weeks. With clone recipes at the ready for popular items such as these (both of which I previously cloned in another book and on our website at TopSecretRecipes.com), scarcity of your favorite food products is no longer an issue.</p><p>Location: When you were in Indianapolis you had the best shrimp cocktail of your life at St. Elmo Steak House and now you&#x2019;re back home in Poughkeepsie with a deep craving for it. Good thing you have a clone recipe for St. Elmo Steak House World Famous Shrimp Cocktail here to satisfy your otherwise insatiable urge, so that you can treat yourself to a food that&#x2019;s only available in a specific part of the country. It&#x2019;s also nice to have a handy clone rec...</p></p><h2>The Book of Honor : The Secret Lives and Deaths of CIA Operatives</h2><p><b>A national bestseller, this extraordinary work of investigative reporting uncovers the identities, and the remarkable stories, of the CIA secret agents who died anonymously in the service of their country.</b><br><br>In the entrance of the CIA headquarters looms a huge marble wall into which seventy-one stars are carved-each representing an agent who has died in the line of duty. Official CIA records only name thirty-five of them, however. Undeterred by claims that revealing the identities of these "nameless stars" might compromise national security, Ted Gup sorted through thousands of documents and interviewed over 400 CIA officers in his attempt to bring their long-hidden stories to light. The result of this extraordinary work of investigation is a surprising glimpse at the real lives of secret agents, and an unprecedented history of the most compelling&#x2014;and controversial&#x2014;department of the US government.</p><p>Inscribed on a wall at Central Intelligence Agency headquarters in Langley, Virginia, is a quote from the Bible: "And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:32). On the other side of the lobby, five rows of stars are etched into the white marble wall, each representing a CIA officer killed in the line of duty. Below the stars is a case containing the "Book of Honor"--"a tome as sacred to the Agency as if it held a splinter of the true cross," writes Ted Gup--and in it are the names of the men and women who gave their lives serving the CIA. Well, not all the names; about half the entries are blank because the CIA says it doesn't want to compromise ongoing operations. Yet, as Gup argues in his own tome, also called <i>The Book of Honor</i>, the truth behind many of the stories that aren't being told threatens nothing--except perhaps the agency's own sense of shame over botched operations. <p> Gup, a well-known investigative reporter with experience at <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Time</i>, interviewed hundreds of current and former CIA case officers to tell the stories behind the stars. "In the aggregate, the stories of the stars form a kind of constellation that, once connected, reveal not only the CIA's history but something of its soul as well," he writes. Yet this is, thankfully, not an indiscrete book. He writes of "a young woman who died a violent and selfless death in 1996 ... her name is withheld from this book. The Agency made a compelling case that to identify her would put others at risk." The bulk of <i>The Book of Honor</i> does, in fact, name names and describe how they died. In this sense, it is similar to the runaway bestseller <i>Blind Man's Bluff</i>, which described the secret history of American submarine espionage during the cold war. Yet what's most striking about Gup's accounts is how many of the deaths were routine or accidental. Many agents merely had the misfortune of being on planes that crashed--hardly the stuff of a James Bond adventure. Throughout, Gup is sensitive to a situation in which, "between the values of an open society and the demands of a craft rooted in deception and betrayal, the CIA is asked to steer an uneasy, often irreconcilable course." This fascinating book strikes a clean blow for the open society--but it serves a larger purpose as well: telling the truth. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>In the entrance of the CIA headquarters looms a huge marble wall into which seventy-one stars are carved-each representing an agent who has died in the line of duty.

In the Diamond Sutra, the Buddha responds to a disciple's question about how to become a Buddha. <i>The Diamond that Cuts Through Illusion</i> presents a dialogue between the Buddha and his disciple, Subhuti, which illuminates how our minds construct limited categories of thought. The answer: we must move beyond personal enlightenment to follow the path of the Bodhisattvas, fully enlightened beings who postpone Nirvana in order to alleviate the suffering of others. It offers us alternative ways to look at the world in its wholeness so we can encounter a deeper reality; develop reverence for the environment and more harmonious communities, families, and relationships; and act in the world skillfully and effectively.<br><br>This revised edition includes Thich Nhat Hanh&#x2019;s translation of the Sutra from the Chinese and, in his commentaries, his own diamond sharp insight, including new work on the environmental implications of the Diamond Sutra.

Through this incredible archive, <i>Frida Kahlo: Making Her Self Up </i>gives readers a unique window into Kahlo&#x2019;s life.

The trilogy earned author Conrad Richter immense acclaim, ranking him with the greatest of American mid-century novelists. It includes <i>The Trees</i> (1940), <i>The Fields</i> (1946), and <i>The Town</i> (1950) and follows the varied fortunes of Sayward Luckett and her family in southeastern Ohio.<br><br> The Fields tells the story of Sayward as a wife and mother, working with her own brood on that hard frontier to create a durable home, and aspects of civilization in a region where life is still difficult and towns are just beginning to appear. It is a rich and human novel about personal conflicts and strife in the midst of a land that itself is striving. And it has an epic quality that perfectly reflects the sweeping conquest of the frontier.<br></p><p><br>Before becoming one of America&#x2019;s greatest novelists, <b>Conrad Richter</b> (1890&#x2013;1968) worked driving a wagon over the mountains of Pennsylvania, in a machine shop, in a small-town bank, on a farm, in his own timber business, and reporting for newspapers, among other jobs.

In truth, I sounded a wee bit hysterical, and I wished with all sincerity that I had walked into the kitchen five minutes later.</p><p>Then again, since the kitchen was one of the common rooms in the main building, I could have walked in when Aggie was halfway through her lunch, which I&#x2019;m sure would have been more distressing for at least one of us.</p><p>&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t I eat it?&#x201d; She looked at the eyeball rolling around in the small bowl that was now sitting on the counter. &#x201c;Nobody else wants it. It&#x2019;s starting to get squooshy. And the dead man doesn&#x2019;t need it.&#x201d;</p><p>The words got me past the physical evidence. &#x201c;What dead man?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The one who doesn&#x2019;t need the eyeball.&#x201d; Little black feathers suddenly sprouted at her hairline, confirming the nature of my lodger. I was going to have to rework the rental agreement so that there was a space for unimportant bits of information like&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. oh, say&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. species.</p><p>&#x201c;Where did you find the dead man?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;On the farm track that runs alongside Crabby Man&#x2019;s place.&#x201d;</p><p>I should have pointed out that Mr. Milford wasn&#x2019;t usually crabby, but he did get exercised when someone took one bite out of all the ripe strawberries or pinched fruit from his trees, since he and his wife needed the income they made from selling fresh fruit and homemade preserves. But there were other priorities.</p><p>&#x201c;Show me.&#x201d; I held up a hand. &#x201c;Wait. And don&#x2019;t nibble.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t eat it. It could be evidence.&#x201d;</p><p>Her dark eyes filled with reproach. &#x201c;If I hadn&#x2019;t wanted to warm it up because it was squooshy, you wouldn&#x2019;t have known about the dead man and I could have had eyeball for lunch.&#x201d;</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t refute that statement, so I backed up until I reached the wall phone in the kitchen, and then I dialed the emergency number for the Bristol Police Station. Bristol was a human town located at the southern end of Crystal Lake. Sproing, the only human village near Lake Silence, was currently without its own police force, so Bristol had drawn the short straw and had to respond to any of our calls for help.</p><p>&#x201c;Bristol Police Station. What is your emergency?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This is Victoria DeVine at The Jumble in Sproing. One of my lodgers found a dead man.&#x201d; Okay, Aggie was my only lodger, but there was no reason to advertise that. Right?</p><p>I started counting and reached seven before the dispatcher said, &#x201c;Did you see the body?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, but my lodger did.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How do you know the body is dead?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking at an eyeball that used to be attached to the body.&#x201d;</p><p>This time I counted to eight.</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll send someone.&#x201d; The words were slow in coming, but at least they were said and would be officially noted somewhere.</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t blame the dispatcher for hesitating to send someone to Sproing&#x2014;after all, the police officer we&#x2019;d had before last year&#x2019;s Great Predation had been eaten, and a couple of officers who had answered calls since then had provoked something in the wild country and never made it back to their station&#x2014;but I resented that I could feel her blaming me for whatever the police were going to find. On the other hand, I did withhold one tiny bit of information.</p><p>Just wait until the responding officer realized he had to interview one of the terra indigene.</p><p>A bit of useful information. My name is Victoria &#x201c;call me Vicki&#x201d; DeVine. I used to be Mrs. Yorick Dane, but giving up my married name was one of the conditions of my receiving valuable property&#x2014;aka The Jumble&#x2014;as part of the divorce settlement. Apparently the second official Mrs. Dane didn&#x2019;t like the idea that someone else had had the name first. Fortunately, she didn&#x2019;t seem as possessive about Yorick&#x2019;s Vigorous Appendage. I could have told her that a couple dozen other women had had it before she took possession. But it wasn&#x2019;t likely that she would keep solo possession of the appendage for long, so let her figure things out the hard way like I did. Of course, if she had been one of those indulgences, then she already knew the signs and might be able to nip them in the bud. Maybe that&#x2019;s why, before I had moved away from Hubb NE, I had seen her in the garden center buying long-handled loppers&#x2014;the kind used to prune branches&#x2014;when I&#x2019;d heard her loudly proclaiming the previous week that gardening was a hobby for women who couldn&#x2019;t do anything else and so not of interest to her.</p><p>Anyway, I was married to Yorick Dane, an entrepreneur&#x2014;aka wheeler-dealer&#x2014;although I never understood what sort of deals were wheeled. He said I didn&#x2019;t have a head for business. I finally said I didn&#x2019;t have a head for cheating of any kind. Suddenly, after a decade of marriage, he said I wasn&#x2019;t living up to the promises that were implied by my name, meaning I wasn&#x2019;t hot or in any way sexy. The fact that it took him a decade to realize I was fivefoot four and plump instead of a five-foot-ten pole dancer with big tits was confusing. But once he made that discovery, he decided that he needed someone who would stand by him, and that would not be me.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s how I came to be the owner of The Jumble. According to the story that was muttered by Yorick&#x2019;s family once they&#x2019;d had a little too much to drink, The Jumble was conceived and built by Yorick&#x2019;s great-great-aunt, Honoria Dane, a woman who was equal parts visionary and eccentric. She and her brothers were given equal shares in their father&#x2019;s fortune, the shares being dispersed upon the child&#x2019;s twenty-fifth birthday. Great-great (I never heard anyone refer to her by her given name) had sunk her part of the fortune into building The Jumble. It was supposed to be a self-sufficient and self-supporting community. It began its genteel decline almost from the moment Great-great finished building it.</p><p>The Jumble consisted of the sprawling two-story main house, which had a small but fully equipped apartment for the owner as well as two suites with private bathrooms for guests. It also had a big communal kitchen, a dining room, a library, a social room, an office for the owner, several empty rooms whose use I couldn&#x2019;t identify, and a large shower area off the kitchen that could accommodate up to four people at a time as long as they weren&#x2019;t shy. Besides the main house, there were four sets of cabins&#x2014;three connected cabins to a set&#x2014;within easy walking distance from the main building. Each cabin was similar to an efficiency apartment with an open floor plan&#x2014;no walls or doors for anything but the bathroom. Well, the three lakeside cabins that were closest to the main building had en suite bathrooms. The other nine cabins were a bit more primitive and an ongoing project.</p><p>There were acres of land that could be used by the&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. beings&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. in residence&#x2014;plenty of room for growing food or raising a goat or two for whatever reason one keeps goats. There was even a chicken coop, sans chickens. It was probably sans a few other things, but if the chickens couldn&#x2019;t pay rent, I couldn&#x2019;t afford to update their lodgings. But The Jumble had one thing the village of Sproing did not&#x2014;it included easy access to Lake Silence, which was an afterthought body of water compared to the other Finger Lakes. There was a public beach at the southern end of the lake, but I thought The Jumble&#x2019;s private beach and dock were a lot nicer.</p><p>Whoever negotiated the original lease agreement for the use of the land knew every devious loophole a person might try to use to rezone/repurpose/re-something the land. But the terms were brutally simple: it was The Jumble with its set number of buildings of a particular size and so many acres of cultivated land (being a modest percentage of the overall acreage) or nothing. The Dane inheritance was actually the buildings and their contents. The land could be used only within the terms of the lease.</p><p>Last bit of information. Sproing is a human village with a population of less than three hundred. Like most, if not all, of the villages in the Finger Lakes area, it is not human controlled. Sure, we have an elected mayor and village council, and we pay taxes for garbage pickup and road maintenance and things like that. The main difference is this: on the continent of Thaisia, a human-controlled town is a defined piece of land with boundaries, and humans can do anything they want within those boundaries. But villages like Sproing don&#x2019;t have a boundary, don&#x2019;t have that distance from the terra indigene. The earth natives. The Others. The dominant predators that control most of the land throughout the world and all of the water.</p><p>When a place has no boundaries, you never really know what&#x2019;s out there watching you.</p><p>The surprising thing is there hadn&#x2019;t been a reported interaction with one of the Others in decades. At least around Sproing. Maybe the Others have been coming in and buying come sproing with me or i [heart] sproingers T-shirts without anyone realizing it, but even though the village lost about a quarter of its residents because of last summer&#x2019;s Great Predation, everyone still wanted to believe that the Others were Out There and didn&#x2019;t find us interesting enough&#x2014;or bothersome enough&#x2014;to hunt down and have as snacks.</p><p>Which made me wonder if the Others came into town seasonally, like tourists. And that made me wonder if everyone had missed the obvious when stores ran out of condiments like ketchup and hot sauce some weekends&#x2014;and whether a run on ketchup and hot sauce coincided with people disappearing.</p></p><h2>Samson and the Pirate Monks: Calling Men to Authentic Brotherhood</h2><p><p>With no-holds-barred honesty and poignant storytelling, Nate Larkin introduces a model of community and friendship that is reinvigorating men's ministry across the country, a model he calls The Samson Society. Too many men see the biblical hero Samson as their model for manhood--a rugged individualist of the highest order. Yet, Samson's solitary successes were eventually overcome by moral weaknesses. Larkin, through the story of his own past and the stories of those in The Samson Society, offers a radical, refreshing alternative.</p></p><p>Nate Larkin, a former pastor who earned his M.Div. from Princeton Theological Seminary, is now a freelance writer and speaking coach, as well as the founder of The Samson Society.Currently in vogue is "the Christian Men's Movement," a reaction to the perceived feminization of Christianity and an attempt to help men realize their God-given missions in the world. Using the biblical Samson as a model, Larkin offers "The Samson Society," a coming together of evangelical men to encourage and help each other on the road to a full Christian life. Though blessed with great strength and a pleasing physique, Samson suffered from moral lapses and a lack of clarity about his mission. In the end, this would be his undoing. Larkin uses Samson's story to show how he and his fellow churchmen&#x2014;the "pirate monks" of the subtitle&#x2014;must focus more fully on the moral and ethical challenges of being a Christian, and less on the physical and the superficial. Describing themselves as loners, wanderers and liars, these men set out to correct their shortcomings and align themselves with what they perceive as God's true plan for their lives. Included is a plan for Christian men to begin their own Samson Society. Written in a breezy, comfortable style, Larkin offers a workable plan for men to identify their spiritual dysfunctions, though he offers little that hasn't been said by other proponents of the Christian men's movement. <i>(Feb. 20)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Do you work for one of those visionary software companies where people come to work wearing hiking boots and glacier glasses, as if a wall of ice were about to come sliding through the parking lot? If so, you might be a Bobo. <br> In his bestselling work of "comic sociology," David Brooks coins a new word, <i>Bobo,</i> to describe today's upper class -- those who have wed the bourgeois world of capitalist enterprise to the hippie values of the bohemian counterculture. Their hybrid lifestyle is the atmosphere we breathe, and in this witty and serious look at the cultural consequences of the information age, Brooks has defined a new generation.</p><p>You've seen them: They sip double-tall, nonfat lattes, chat on cell phones, and listen to NPR while driving their immaculate SUVs to Pottery Barn to shop for $48 titanium spatulas. They tread down specialty cheese aisles in top-of-the-line hiking boots and think nothing of laying down $5 for an olive-wheatgrass muffin. They're the bourgeois bohemians--"Bobos"--an unlikely blend of mainstream culture and 1960s-era counterculture that, according to David Brooks, represents both America's present and future: "These Bobos define our age. They are the new establishment. Their hybrid culture is the atmosphere we all breathe. Their status codes now govern social life." Amusing stereotypes aside, they're an "elite based on brainpower" and merit rather than pedigree or lineage: "Dumb good-looking people with great parents have been displaced by smart, ambitious, educated, and antiestablishment people with scuffed shoes." <p> <i>Bobos in Paradise</i> is a brilliant, breezy, and often hilarious study of the "cultural consequences of the information age." Large and influential (especially in terms of their buying power), the Bobos have reformed society through culture rather than politics, and Brooks clearly outlines this passing of the high-class torch by analyzing nearly all aspects of life: consumption habits, business and lifestyle choices, entertainment, spirituality, politics, and education. Employing a method he calls "comic sociology," Brooks relies on keen observations, wit, and intelligence rather than statistics and hard theory to make his points. And by copping to his own Bobo status, he comes across as revealing rather than spiteful in his dead-on humor. Take his description of a typical grocery store catering to discriminating Bobos: "The visitor to Fresh Fields is confronted with a big sign that says 'Organic Items today: 130.' This is like a barometer of virtue. If you came in on a day when only 60 items were organic, you'd feel cheated. But when the number hits the three figures, you can walk through the aisles with moral confidence."</p><p> Like any self-respecting Bobo, Brooks wears his erudition lightly and comfortably (not unlike, say, an expedition-weight triple-layer Gore-Tex jacket suitable for a Mount Everest assault but more often seen in the gym). But just because he's funny doesn't mean this is not a serious book. On the contrary, it is one of the more insightful works of social commentary in recent memory. His ideas are sharp, his writing crisp, and he even offers pointed suggestions for putting the considerable Bobo political clout to work. And, unlike the classes that spawned them--the hippies and the yuppies--Brooks insists the Bobos are here to stay: "Today the culture war is over, at least in the realm of the affluent. The centuries-old conflict has been reconciled." All the more reason to pay attention. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>David Brooks</b> writes a biweekly Op-Ed column for <i>The New York Times</i> and appears regularly on PBS's <i>The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</i> and NPR's <i>All Things Considered.</i> He lives in Bethesda, Maryland.</p><h2>Stories That Must Not Die</h2><p>Folk tales help illuminate the history and spirit of the Mexican-US border.

It isn't some abstract concept or wacky business strategy&#x2014;it's real, and every one of us is doing business in it every day, whether we choose to recognize it or not. It's the way we communicate, the way we buy and sell, the way businesses and consumers interact online and offline. The Internet, where <em>The Thank You Economy</em> was born, has given consumers back their voice, and the tremendous power of their opinions via social media means that companies and brands have to compete on a whole different level than they used to.</p> <p>Gone are the days when a blizzard of marketing dollars could be used to overwhelm the airwaves, shut out the competition, and grab customer awareness. Now customers' demands for authenticity, originality, creativity, honesty, and good intent have made it necessary for companies and brands to revert to a level of customer service rarely seen since our great-grandparents' day, when business owners often knew their customers personally, and gave them individual attention.</p> <p>Here renowned entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk reveals how companies big and small can scale that kind of personal, one-on-one attention to their entire customer base, no matter how large, using the same social media platforms that carry consumer word of mouth. <em>The Thank You Economy</em> offers compelling, data-driven evidence that we have entered into an entirely new business era, one in which the companies that see the biggest returns won't be the ones that can throw the most money at an advertising campaign, but will be those that can prove they care about their customers more than anyone else. The businesses and brands that harness the word-of-mouth power from social media, those that can shift their culture to be more customer-aware and fan-friendly, will pull away from the pack and profit in today's markets.</p> <p>Filled with Vaynerchuk's irrepressible candor and wit, as well as real-world examples of companies that are profiting by putting Thank You Economy principles into practice, <em>The Thank You Economy</em> reveals how businesses can harness all the changes and challenges inherent in social media and turn them into tremendous opportunities for profit and growth.</p></p><p><br> <strong> Amazon Exclusive: Gary Vaynerchuk on <i>The Thank You Economy</i></strong> <br> <br><i>The Thank You Economy</i> is much more than saying "thank you.&#x201d; <i>The Thank You Economy</i> represents a much bigger movement.

We're sharing thoughts that we never would have picked up the phone and called somebody about in the past. What happens when brands can be humanized? In <i>The Thank You Economy</i>, I tackle the issue of the ROI of social media and provide case studies. I think we wrote a much, much stronger book than I did with <i>Crush It</i>. When I say we, I mean the people in the social graph--the people that are living it.</p> <p>There is enormous ROI in social media. It's like my famous saying though, "What's the ROI of your mother?"

I live and breathe my community and I've been able to consult with big brands for the past two years on how to leverage this world of caring.

It offers high school and college students an excellent mathematics workbook of rigorous problems that will assist in developing and cultivating their logic and probability skills.These 20 sets of intriguing problems test originality and insight rather than routine competence. They involve theorizing and verifying mathematical facts; examining the results of general statements; discovering that highly plausible conjectures can be incorrect; solving sequences of subproblems to reveal theory construction; and recognizing &#34;red herrings,&#34; in which obvious relationships among the data prove irrelevant to solutions. Hints for each problem appear in a separate section, and a final section features solutions that outline the appropriate procedures.Ideal for teachers seeking challenging practice math problems for their gifted students, this book will also help students prepare for mathematics, science, and engineering programs. Mathematics buffs of all ages will also find it a source of captivating challenges.</p><p>George P�lya (1887&#x2013;1985) was a professor of mathematics at Stanford University who made lasting contributions to combinatorics, number theory, numerical analysis, and probability theory.

A subterranean realm of eternal suffering, a prison for sinful souls governed by a fallen angel who surpassed all other creatures in wickedness, Hell has inspired fear and thereby controlled the behavior of countless human beings for more than two thousand years. Despite advances in scholarship that have called into question the authority of the Christian scriptures and scientific developments that have changed the way we think about the human race and our place in the cosmos, the idea of Hell has remained tenacious in Western thought. In modern discourse, &#x201c;hell&#x201d; serves as an all-pervasive metaphor for any kind of difficulty (&#x201c;hard as hell&#x201d;) or extreme (&#x201c;hot as hell&#x201d;), but the word has lost none of its religious currency in our so-called age of reason. A 2014 survey by the Pew Research Center found that 58 percent of American adults still believe in the existence of a place &#x201c;where people who have led bad lives and die without being sorry are eternally punished.&#x201d;<br><br> The tenacity of the belief in Hell in the modern world invites inquiry into its long history. Depictions of a punitive afterlife are as old as writing itself. Ancient Mesopotamians imagined a grim otherworld in &#x201c;the house of dust,&#x201d; while ancient Egyptians trembled at the thought of the judgment of the death god Anubis, but these traditions did not exert as much influence on Western culture as the realms of shadow and gloom awaiting the dead as portrayed in the Hebrew scriptures (Sheol) and in Greek and Roman literature (Hades). The account of Aeneas&#x2019;s descent into the underworld and the descriptions of its landscape and megafauna in The Aeneid of the Roman poet Virgil (70&#x2013;19 BCE) were especially formative; the poem would exert an enormous influence on medieval intellectuals and poets, especially Dante Alighieri (1265&#x2013;1321 CE). The earliest Christians thus inherited a rich tradition of thoughts and images about the afterlife from their Jewish and pagan contemporaries, but they were not slavish imitators of other religions in their thinking about the underworld. In the centuries between the time of Christ and the triumph of the Church in the lifetime of Saint Augustine (356&#x2013;430 CE), Christian thinkers began to delineate the contours and function of a distinctly Christian Hell, informed by ancient models yet particular to their own understanding of original sin and God&#x2019;s inscrutable mercy.<br><br> During the first millennium CE, early medieval authors invented a punitive underworld with distinctive features and dire inhabitants and articulated its details in popular stories unauthorized by the Church, including the apostle Paul&#x2019;s guided tour of Hell in the company of an angel and the tradition that Christ descended to the underworld during his three days in the tomb in order to rescue the virtuous Jewish patriarchs from the prison of Hades, the so-called Harrowing of Hell. They also composed vivid and fanciful visionary tours of Hell, its inhabitants, and its torments written with didactic intent to help monastic readers avoid the sins that would bar them from Heaven. The articulation of these beliefs as official Church doctrine took almost a millennium to work out, but by the High Middle Ages (c. 1000&#x2013;1400 CE) theologians like Thomas Aquinas were explaining with detached reason the kinds of punishments that evil persons could expect in Hell and the relationship between the blessed and the damned. At the end of the Middle Ages, Dante Alighieri wedded medieval popular beliefs about the punitive afterlife and the reasoned deductions of scholastic thinkers about the workings of divine punishment in his towering poem <i>The Divine Comedy</i>. His poetic portrayal of Hell (Inferno) represented the apogee of the punitive underworld in the medieval imagination.<br><br> Early modern thinkers challenged medieval understandings of Hell during the Protestant Reformation. In the sixteenth century, Protestant reformers agreed with their Catholic rivals that Hell was the destination of the wicked, but they were much more likely to couch the punitive afterlife in abstract terms of remorse and wounded conscience rather than in concrete terms of torment in Hell-fire familiar from the Catholic tradition. New scientific knowledge and social change in the nineteenth century brought the concept of Hell to the center of debate once again, as Victorian Christians cast doubt on the merciless perpetuity of infernal punishment, while defending their belief in the afterlife in the face of evolutionary theories forwarded by Darwin and other scientists. During this period, secular criticism of the very concept of Hell abounded. Surely, the idea of a punitive afterlife had no place in a world governed by science and reason?<br><br> Despite the erosion of traditional religious beliefs in the modern era, Hell has survived and prospered. While the belief in Hell as an actual place has declined in recent centuries, the idea of Hell has endured as a dominant metaphor and, frighteningly, as an inspiration for how to treat other people. From the world wars and the Holocaust to the plight of prisoners and detainees, the political calamities of the modern world have increased the currency of the concept of Hell as a metaphor for torment and suffering. Although many modern people have turned their backs on a literal understanding of Hell as a place of future punishment, they nonetheless draw inspiration from imaginative traditions about the punitive afterlife to cause suffering to others in this present life, to &#x201c;give them hell.&#x201d; The modern technologies and rational ways of thinking that supposedly mark our progress over earlier generations now allow us to commit mass murder and replicate infernal landscapes at the touch of a button; in an ironic reversal, we have become the very demons our ancestors trembled to meet when death foreclosed on their lives.<br><br> In this book, the reader will discover the many forms that the torments of Hell have taken in the Western imagination, with sinful souls immersed in rivers of fire, gnawed away by giant worms, bound up in fiery chains, trembling in intense cold, and devoured whole by hellish monsters. The landscape of Hell is as diverse as its torments. In medieval visions, monks and knights traversed towering mountains, dark valleys, and fetid swamps filled with demons and mythological creatures. In modern accounts, Hell became a vast prison of red-hot iron and choking smoke with great gates built to withstand the seething tide of furious, tormented souls who crashed inexorably against them in their futile attempt to escape their suffering. The literature of Hell boasts famous villains, but most of the damned are ordinary people like you and me, each judged to be deserving of eternal punishment for their own private sins. Stories about Hell were almost always didactic and hortatory; they were written to teach the reader by evoking fear and thereby to persuade the sinner to seek absolution through confession or, better yet, to avoid sin altogether. This does not make them any easier to read. More frightening still, even as Hell has begun to lose its grip on the modern imagination as a place of eternal punishment, it has persisted as a dominant metaphor in Western society and has played a formative role in the ways that we treat one another. Despite all of our recourse to reason and compassion, the power of Hell has not been undone.</p><h2>The March: A Novel</h2><p>WINNER OF THE NATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD<br>WINNER OF THE PEN/FAULKNER AWARD<br>NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER<br><br>In 1864, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman marched his sixty thousand troops through Georgia to the sea, and then up into the Carolinas. The army fought off Confederate forces, demolished cities, and accumulated a borne-along population of freed blacks and white refugees until all that remained was the dangerous transient life of the dispossessed and the triumphant. In E. L. Doctorow&#x2019;s hands the great march becomes a floating world, a nomadic consciousness, and an unforgettable reading experience with awesome relevance to our own times.</p><p>As the Civil War was moving toward its inevitable conclusion, General William Tecumseh Sherman marched 60,000 Union troops through Georgia and the Carolinas, leaving a 60-mile-wide trail of death, destruction, looting, thievery and chaos. In <i>The March</i>, E.L. Doctorow has put his unique stamp on these events by staying close to historical fact, naming real people and places and then imagining the rest, as he did in <i>Ragtime</i>. <p> Recently, the Civil War has been the subject of novels by Howard Bahr, Michael Shaara, Charles Frazier, and Robert Hicks, to name a few. Its perennial appeal is due not only to the fact that it was fought on our own soil, but also that it captures perfectly our long-time and ongoing ambivalence about race. Doctorow examines this question extensively, chronicling the dislocation of both southern whites and Negroes as Sherman burned and destroyed all that they had ever known. Sherman is a well-drawn character, pictured as a crazy tactical genius pitted against his West Point counterparts. Doctorow creates a context for the march: "The brutal romance of war was still possible in the taking of spoils. Each town the army overran was a prize... There was something undeniably classical about it, for how else did the armies of Greece and Rome supply themselves?" </p><p> The characters depicted on the march are those people high and low, white and black, whose lives are forever changed by war: Pearl, the newly free daughter of a white plantation owner and one of his slaves, Colonel Sartorius, a competent, remote, almost robotic surgeon; several officers, both Union and Confederate; two soldiers, Arly and Will, who provide comic relief in the manner of Shakespeare's fools until, suddenly, their roles are not funny anymore. </p><p> Doctorow has captured the madness of war in his description of the condition of a dispossessed Southern white woman: "What was clear at this moment was that Mattie Jameson's mental state befitted the situation in which she found herself. The world at war had risen to her affliction and made it indistinguishable." And later, " This was not war as adventure, nor war for a solemn cause, it was war at its purest, a mindless mass rage severed from any cause, ideal, or moral principle." </p><p> As we have come to expect, Doctorow puts the reader in the picture; never more so than in recalling "The March" and letting us see it as a cautionary tale for our times. <i>--Valerie Ryan</i></p><b>E.

The former fitness director for the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Orton now personally oversees the training of dozens of athletes, from recreational racers to elite ultramarathoners.<b>You In Glorious Jackson Hole </b><br><br>Okay. enough about me and the near past.<br><br>This is about you and your near future. You, the athlete&#x2014;and I use that word with full consideration and intent. Because wherever you are in your running life, you can make the choice to be an athlete. You can adopt that mind-set and make it your own defining essence. Being an athlete is not something you&#x2019;re &#x201c;born with.&#x201d; That&#x2019;s a misconception, a myth, really, that is all too often also an impediment&#x2014;or, even worse, an excuse. Being an athlete <i>is</i> a choice. And making that choice, taking up that mind-set, is the step that allows you to move toward a new level of achievement. That&#x2019;s what this book is about. And that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m going to ask of you.<br><br>The truth is, athleticism is awareness. That simple phrase is at the core of my program. When I say, &#x201c;Athleticism is awareness,&#x201d; what I mean is that to be an athlete means you are someone who is aware of your form and technique; aware of how you move your body; aware of your effort level, of your breathing pattern; aware of what you eat (and don&#x2019;t eat); and, most important, aware of what you think (and don&#x2019;t think).<br><br>We will go deeper into that idea later, but first we need to address the physical side of things. I believe firmly that the mind follows the body. And when the mind follows a good body, it gets to the right place. So that is where we will begin the journey&#x2014;your journey&#x2014;to the Cool Impossible.<br><br>To get started, I am going to ask you to look at things maybe a little differently than you&#x2019;ve looked at them in the past. I&#x2019;m going to introduce you to some new ideas and concepts and ask you to do some new things that will help to catapult your running to another level and help you get everything that you want out of every mile. Along the way, I am going to challenge you to go above and beyond what you think is possible for yourself, for your running, and, I hope, even your life.<br><br>And to be clear, this process, this challenge&#x2014;this opportunity&#x2014;is open to every runner. This book is for you whether you&#x2019;re a beginner, or a veteran hoping to reclaim that beginner&#x2019;s enthusiasm and sense of possibility; whether you&#x2019;re a dedicated competitor, gearing your efforts to improvements in time and placings at key races, or a recreational runner, excited about the social aspects of the sport; whether you&#x2019;re someone whose running has been interrupted or compromised by chronic injury, or an enthusiastic experimenter inspired by visions of barefoot running, the Tarahumara Indians, and other adventures. This commitment to awareness will&#x2014;like Frost&#x2019;s choice between two roads diverging in a wood&#x2014;make all the difference.<br><br>One element of what you will learn later is how important and powerful a role visualization plays in performance. The mind follows the body and, in turn, performance follows the mind. But harnessing that sequence, controlling it and making it work for us to carry us to where we want to go, is a challenge&#x2014;and one that often goes unrecognized. We have lost touch with the art of daydreaming. I don&#x2019;t mean the kind of daydreaming that comes after a few hours of surfing vacation Web sites or buying that lottery ticket. We&#x2019;re all pretty good at that. No, I mean the kind of daydreaming that can help guide our performance and prepare us for the journey to the Cool Impossible.<br><br>So let&#x2019;s give it a try. Let&#x2019;s do it. Right now. Rather than simply telling you what&#x2019;s going to come in the chapters ahead&#x2014;laying out the programs and the protocols, explaining the mechanics, the physiology and the psychology&#x2014;I&#x2019;m going to give you a chance to live it. I wake up each day in Jackson thrilled anew to find myself in what is truly a running and adventure-sport paradise, living the kind of life that I once could only imagine. But that&#x2019;s the point: I <i>did</i> imagine it, and now it&#x2019;s as real as the vast, jagged face of the Teton Range that beckons me each time I step out of my house, or the bear that ambles across the trail ahead of me on my morning run, or the lung-searing challenge of an uphill sprint at nine thousand feet. I want to make it just as real for you.<br><br>I want you to imagine that you are on your way to visit me in Jackson Hole for an intense seven-day running camp. This one-on-one camp will be like no other running you&#x2019;ve ever done and will introduce you to and immerse you in every element of my training program. Jackson Hole is the real deal, the true Wild West. It&#x2019;s here that you can find your own frontier and be shocked into a new reality. I am hoping this is what you expect from your visit and from this book, because it is what I want for you.<br>So, here you are. . . . It&#x2019;s been a short flight from Denver or Salt Lake City (or wherever you made your connection, because, face it, unless you&#x2019;ve got a private jet you&#x2019;re not flying direct to Jackson). But it is a leap into another realm. The plane drops down out of the clouds and suddenly there it all is, a landscape so sweeping and majestic that it makes you almost laugh as you press your face to the little square of the window: the mountains, saw edged and brilliantly snowcapped, marching out to the horizon; the Snake River running its sinuous course through the valleys; the burnished tans and greens of the headlands. We are most certainly not in Kansas (in real or metaphorical terms) anymore.<br><br>You can see immediately why they call it Jackson <i>Hole</i>. The floor of the valley sits at sixty-five hundred feet, but the Tetons on the western side soar like a wall to thirteen thousand feet, and the Gros Ventre Range to the east tops out near twelve thousand feet. Trappers and hunters who found their way to the region in the early nineteenth century must have felt they were literally going over the edge as they climbed down the steep canyons into the vast encircled expanse. It still feels that way today, as the plane drops down, far below the peaks, and settles in for a landing at Jackson Hole Airport, which, with its low-slung rustic design, seems to blend in with the flat expanse of the valley.<br><br>No Jetway here. You grab your bag, running shoes dangling from the handle, and exit the plane directly onto the tarmac. You take a deep breath. The air is exhilarating and the sky astoundingly wide and close. As you follow the concrete path toward the terminal, you turn to look at the mountains, and it&#x2019;s like they&#x2019;re right there in your face. Your eye traces the wild, zigzag lines of the peaks&#x2014;dominated by the central massif, the truly majestic Grand Teton&#x2014;and follows the canyons cutting up in deep, dark Vs between the rises. You try to imagine running there, following a trail up to the Teton Crest. It seems like another world. Another you, perhaps.<br><br>Welcome to Jackson: That sort of spectacular vista, with its promise and its challenge, is everywhere here. It is also the reason why you&#x2019;re here. In the next few days you&#x2019;re going to get a firsthand taste of all that Jackson has to offer, and at the same time an introduction to my running program, a taste of what I&#x2019;ll be asking you to do, and a glimpse of where these new elements and new ways of thinking can take you&#x2014;in your running and in your life.<br><br>We meet outside the airport. I&#x2019;m the shaved-headed, skinny guy with rounded shoulders and a cheery smile. I&#x2019;m happy to see you, after all. I bundle you into my truck and off we go, windows down.<br><br>On the ride into town from the airport we pass buffalo&#x2014;yep, they&#x2019;re roaming&#x2014;beside the road, as well as an elk framed against the sky above a ridge, the same ridge on which we&#x2019;ll put in some quality miles in the days to come. We also pass a trio of cyclists, pulling big gears as they roll down the shoulder not that much slower than we&#x2019;re driving. You&#x2019;ll learn that it&#x2019;s impossible to go for long in Jackson Hole without seeing someone in motion: biking, running, hiking, paddling on the streams, skiing the trails in winter. The most adventure sports&#x2013; happy town in America&#x2014;Chris had it right.<br><br>But on this first night, before we move into action, there&#x2019;s time to sit and talk, to get a sense of where you&#x2019;re coming from, and where we&#x2019;re going to be going in the course of the next seven days&#x2014;and beyond. Over a steak salad or grilled trout at the Snake River Brewery, we&#x2019;ll talk about a lot of things. About Jackson, and the history of the valley. About the Wild West. About skiing at lunchtime and about what twenty-below really feels like. About crazy real-estate prices and about mountain lions. Behind it all, of course, will be that sense of anticipation, of an adventure about to be embarked upon. Maybe you&#x2019;re a little tired or fried from the travel, but you&#x2019;re feeling a buzz, too, that tingle that every runner knows that precedes a big test. And so we&#x2019;ll start talking about the aspects of your upcoming training. Since I&#x2019;m a bottom-up kind of guy, we&#x2019;ll start with your feet.<br><br>Don&#x2019;t worry, we&#x2019;re not going all Barefoot Ted here. My Copper Canyon race companion, and one of the pioneers of barefoot running, has a lot of wisdom to share, but I consider shoeless running a tool&#x2014;something that can help build strength and improve form for all runners&#x2014;rather than as an objective in and of itself, or even, as some would have it, a lifestyle. Remember, the Tarahumara sport those huaraches, not bare feet, across their rocky trails. For now, we&#x2019;re going to concentrate on strengthening the feet, and it&#x2019;s crucial that you can feel&#x2014;really <i>feel</i>&#x2014;what we&#x2019;re doing.<br><br>Take your shoes off. It&#x2019;s okay&#x2014;we&#x2019;re in Jackson here; you won&#x2019;t be the first at this establishment. Now look down at those feet, maybe a little pale below the sock line, the toes spreading and gripping the tile floor. For all the usual focus on leg strength, flexibility, and core fitness, when it comes to running, everything springs, quite literally, from those two kind of funny-looking appendages. Just as a race car, no matter how big an engine it has or how sophisticated a suspension, depends on four small patches of tire on asphalt to get around a track, a runner&#x2019;s performance and health are rooted in the actions of the foot, with its twenty-six bones, thirty-three joints, and more than a hundred muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Having strong feet promotes proper muscle usage all the way up the leg and throughout the core, ultimately creating the muscle equilibrium that is so important to successful running, and that&#x2019;s what we&#x2019;ll be working on throughout your training.<br><br>Maybe you&#x2019;re imagining a gym full of machines and clanking iron; maybe you sneaked a peek down at your biceps last time you raised your glass, or you&#x2019;re trying to remember how much you hoisted the last time you did heavy leg squats. But strength training is not about how much you can lift. That&#x2019;s not the challenge. The challenge is to have an open mind about what the objective is. Strength training is about muscle equilibrium&#x2014;about making sure that the big, prime-mover muscles in the body don&#x2019;t overwhelm the smaller supporting muscles, pulling the entire system out of balance and compromising efficiency. It&#x2019;s more important how well we move and how efficient we are in using our strength than how much weight we can toss around.<br><br>And the amazing thing is that this muscle equilibrium, this <i>athletic</i> strength, will help you to run better. It will also prevent the all too familiar aches and pains and stiffness that can sometimes seem like the unavoidable price of running.<br><br>Let me be very clear about this: These aches, these pains, they are avoidable. You may have been conditioned to think otherwise, but over the course of our time together, I will show you different. With strength, muscle equilibrium, good form, and a proper training program, we can eliminate those common running ailments, have more fun, and achieve tremendous performance enhancements.<br><br>Easy, now; I don&#x2019;t want to overwhelm you. Let&#x2019;s pay the check, take a walk down Town Square. It&#x2019;s not Times Square, New York City, but what we lack in glittering lights, we make up for in quiet charm and a backdrop that takes the breath away.<br><br>I want to know some more about you. If you&#x2019;re shy, don&#x2019;t be. This is important. Before I begin coaching any athlete, I like to get a detailed sense of where he is in his running career. We runners love to talk running. It&#x2019;s our currency of exchange, as natural as putting one foot in front of the other. So let&#x2019;s talk about past races, the good ones and the ones that kicked our butts. Let&#x2019;s talk about workouts and recent long runs; tell me about your favorite route and how fast you&#x2019;ve covered it recently. And in the process I&#x2019;ll get a sense of your experience level and where you are in your training. And I&#x2019;ll ask you&#x2014;just as you no doubt are asking yourself&#x2014;what your goals are. What do you want out of your running&#x2014;from the season ahead, in terms of a specific race or training goal, to a lifetime ahead on the road or trails? If you are not a racer, we can discuss how races can personally empower you and foster a sense of adventure in your running.<br><br>Okay, that&#x2019;s a lot of talk and very little action. It&#x2019;d be nice to grab a beer together&#x2014;or, if that&#x2019;s not your thing, a coffee or tea. But this first night, it shouldn&#x2019;t be a late one. We&#x2019;ve got a whole week ahead of us, and it&#x2019;s time to turn in. I&#x2019;ll file away what I&#x2019;ve gleaned about your running past and your goals for the future.<br><br>Back at your hotel, you settle in to sleep, your window open to the cool mountain air and all that awaits outside on the trails of Jackson.<br>An hour after sunrise, the steep slopes of the Tetons are sharply etched in soaring lines of light and shadow, and the rolling foothills are rising into burnished greens and gold. We meet at the Cache Creek Canyon trailhead. A popular hiking, biking, and cross-country trail that runs along Cache Creek close to downtown Jackson, this will be an ideal setting for a short shakeout run. This is not a workout. It&#x2019;s just to get the blood flowing, an easy, roly-poly outing in the woods, a chance for you to get acclimated to the altitude and for me to watch you run.<br><br>We&#x2019;ll go for thirty-five to forty minutes, whatever feels comfortable. I&#x2019;ll keep the instructions intentionally vague at the beginning&#x2014; nothing more complicated or nuanced than, &#x201c;Take it easy&#x201d;&#x2014;since the important thing is to get a sense of how you naturally run. I&#x2019;ll be watching your form, and to do that I&#x2019;ll move around on the trail, leading for a while and then dropping back to follow. I might speed up the pace for a stretch and then slow it back down. I&#x2019;ll be looking to see how you respond: Do you push to keep up&#x2014;despite those instructions at the start to keep it easy? Or do you do your own thing? I&#x2019;ll be looking to see how confident you are in your own pace.<br><br>You can learn a vast amount about people just by going on an easy run with them. Every step reveals a wealth of detail, and I&#x2019;m making notes in my head as we go along: <i>Hey, her pace is good, or Hmm, his stride crosses over; He&#x2019;s not using his glutes; or She&#x2019;s a heel striker.</i> All of this gives me a road map for going forward.<br><br>I&#x2019;m an expert at running and talking&#x2014;comes with the job. So let me cover a little about form as we go. Like I told Chris, there&#x2019;s a right and a wrong way to run, and I&#x2019;m here to teach you the difference. The specifics will come later. For now, let&#x2019;s address the significance of form.<br><br>When we have good form, we run efficiently. With bad form . . . wait for it . . . you&#x2019;re running inefficiently. Bad form forces you to use some muscles more, and others less, than is optimal. Over time, the ones we use strengthen; the ones we don&#x2019;t weaken. It&#x2019;s not rocket science. This disparity throws off the body equilibrium I told you about before. When that happens, you create tightness in your muscles, and you suffer from common running ailments...</p><h2>Joy of Fearing God, The</h2><p><b>What Kind of Relationship Can You Have with Someone You Fear?<br><br></b>For most of us, fear is something we try to avoid. And fearing God hardly sounds like an occasion for joy. But Jerry Bridges shows how the fear of the Lord is actually the key that opens the door to a life of true knowledge, wisdom, blessing, and joy.<br><br>We all want a deeper, more intimate relationship with God&#x2013;one that&#x2019;s characterized by joy. But how does fearing God lead to joy? After all, aren&#x2019;t we supposed to love Him and live in intimate relationship with Him? Jerry Bridges explores this paradox as he unpacks the biblical promise that God delights in those who fear Him. Join him as he unveils the awesome greatness of God&#x2013;His incredible holiness, deep wisdom, and especially His inspiring love. You&#x2019;ll gain a deeper understanding of who God is that will draw you into a truly biblical, and surprisingly delightful, fear of God&#x2013;a fear that includes your own genuine, heartfelt delight in God.<br><br>You&#x2019;ll make the startling discovery that the fear of the Lord, far from being something to avoid, is the key to joyful, fulfilling, and genuine intimacy with God. It can change your relationship with God and change your life!

Sproul<br></b><br> &#x201c;Only the fear of God has the power to disarm any other fear that would capture our hearts and control our lives.

This work, The Joy of Fearing God, is no different. The fear of God he writes of in his classic work is one of intense, joyous, intimate relationship with a sovereign God who, though He demands perfect obedience, has nevertheless opened wide his arms of welcome to sinners. It is because we are conscious of both our own sinfulness and His indescribable condescension and love that we run into His presence with worship and awe. I&#x2019;m thankful for Bridges and his commitment to live &#x2018;under the gospel&#x2019; every day. You will be too.&#x201d;<br> &#x2014;<b>Elyse Fitzpatrick</b>, author of Good News for Weary Women<br><br> &#x201c;Joy and fear are not two words that usually go together. Jerry Bridges shows why they do&#x2014;indeed, must&#x2014;go together when it comes to our relationship with God.

It&#x2019;s not merely about fearing God.

Patton</i>.<br><br>Conflicting testimony, disappearing witnesses, missing official reports, a suspicious Stalin, and a lack of autopsy comprise the greatest unsolved mystery of World War II.<br><br>Find out "whodunit" in this thrilling account of America's most famous general.</p><p>He was the most controversial American general in World War II&#x2014;and also one of the most successful, courageous, and audacious. As a postwar administrator of defeated Germany, he sounded alarm bells about the dangers of Soviet encroachment into Europe. Politically, he was a lightning rod&#x2014;an outspoken conservative who continually embarrassed his superiors with his uncensored, undiplomatic, and unrestrained comments to the press. He was General George S. Patton Jr., old Blood and Guts.<br><br>In 1945, shortly before he was to fly home to the states as a conquering hero, he was involved in a mysterious car crash that left him partially paralyzed.<br><br>Two weeks later, just as his doctors were about to send him home to finish his recovery, he was dead.<br>The army ruled the car crash an accident, his death natural. Yet witness testimony on the crash conflicted, key players in the incident disappeared, official reports vanished, soldiers were ordered to keep silent, and there was no autopsy performed on the body.<br><br>Investigative and military reporter Robert Wilcox, author of <i>Black Aces High</i> and <i>Wings of Fury</i>, has spent more than ten years investigating these mysteries, and in <i>Target: Patton</i> he has written an electrifying account of the shocking circumstances&#x2014;long hidden from the public&#x2014;surrounding the death of America's most famous general. In <i>Target: Patton</i>, you'll discover:<br><br>The extraordinary war hero, artist, and mercenary who said he was ordered by U.S. intelligence to assassinate Patton<br>The OSS agent who knew Patton was in danger and tried to save him<br>New evidence from recently declassified documents revealing doubts about the official version of Patton's death<br>The final stories of those involved in the accident, including those who were thought to have disappeared&#x2014;until now<br><br>Provocative, shocking, and compelling, <i>Target: Patton</i> takes you through the maze of denials, contradictions, and treacheries behind one of the great unsolved mysteries of World War II.<br>"Robert Wilcox's <i>Target: Patton</i> has enough twists and turns to satisfy the most demanding murder-mystery fan with the added bonus of historical possibility. Populated with legendary real-life characters, Wilcox introduces the world to Douglas Bazata: a man of action as improbably true as Lawrence of Arabia. With a screenwriter's gift for picture images and a military historian's discipline for detail, Wilcox peels back the decades to the chaotic fi nal chords of WW II and the opening act of the Cold War by asking the heretofore unanswered question: was General George S. Patton murdered?" <br>--Doug McIntyre, KABC Radio/<i>Los Angeles Daily News</i><p> "<i>Target: Patton</i> is a terrific book investigating the mysterious death of one of America's greatest military heroes: General George S. Patton, Jr. Reporter Robert Wilcox takes the reader into the mystery: from Patton's suspicious car crash in Occupied Germany in 1945 to his unexpected death two weeks later, bringing to light new evidence and raising serious questions, all of which makes for a fascinating read."<br>--Paul E. Vallely, Major General, U.S. Army (Ret.) Chairman, Stand Up America USA, Co-author of <i>Endgame: The Blueprint for Victory in the War on Terror</i></p>"I am most surprised to learn in Robert Wilcox's highly readable book that there is a reasonable doubt and more that George Patton's death in Germany in December 1945 was not the result of a car crash but possibly foul play by hired assassins. Certainly there was motive and opportunity, but was there method? Over the years, I had heard a version of this tale based upon German villainy, but never with the detail and matter-of-fact persuasion in <i>Target: Patton</i>. I don't know if he was murdered, but I am no longer sure he wasn't. Exhume the corpse. End the debate."<br>--John Batchelor, host WABC, WMAL, KSFO, KFI</p><h2>Black Sabbath&#39;s Master of Reality (33 1/3)</h2><p>Black Sabbath&#39;s Master of Reality has maintained remarkable historical status over several generations; it&#39;s a touchstone for the directionless, and common coin for young men and women who&#39;ve felt excluded from the broader cultural economy. John Darnielle hears it through the ears of Roger Painter, a young adult locked in a southern California adolescent psychiatric center in 1985; deprived of his Walkman and hungry for comfort, he explains Black Sabbath as one might describe air to a fish, or love to an android, hoping to convince his captors to give him back his tapes.</p><p>John Darnielle is the singer and songwriter otherwise known as the Mountain Goats.Mention in Harp Magazine (Grayson Currin)<br><br>"[T]he focus of Darnielle's fans has always been on hislyrics and the stories contained within them. Now he's stepped off the stage and sat down at is typewriter to deliverMaster of Reality, his first novel and a stunning piece of rock criticism andappreciation.<br>Readers are likely to come to Master of Reality from avariety of backgrounds. Some will comeas Mountain Goats fans wanting to see Darnielle tackle a novel, others as BlackSabbath fans wanting to read about a favorite album. Some will simply be fans of the cult-popular33 1/3 series, which has now grown to dozens of books, yet kept its level ofquality very high. Hopefully, there willbe others who will pick it up as novel first, because it truly is a first-ratestory, full of moments that will pluck at your heartstrings as you're broughtback to the moment you first fell in love with a piece of music, when an albumprovided not just the soundtrack to your life but also the meaning behindit. If, by some strange chance, none ofthis happens, well, you're probably going to at least dust off your old Sabbathvinyl, and there's nothing wrong with that either." &#x2014;NewPages.com <br>"[Darnielle] straightjackets the essence of Black Sabbathwhere 40 years of music musings and cultural damnation have failed." &#x2014;Raoul Hernandez, Austin Chronicle (Raoul Hernandez)<br><br>"Total affection for, and strong identification with, musicis a cross-generational experience, and though the motivation behind the 33 1/3series meshes nicely with a post-Generation X obsession with the minutiae ofpersonal experience, it's also immediately accessible to anyone who's everwritten favorite lyrics on her algebra notebook. While nostalgia runs thick inDarnielle's book (the nature of the series essentially demands this), there's agreater point about music and memory to be found in Roger's story. Indulgencein the memory of intense feelings can be strangely comforting, and perhaps evennecessary. Or, as Roger puts it: 'It doesn't have to mean that to everybody, andit means more no matter what...'"&#x2014; Thea Brown, The L Magazine (Thea Brown)<br><br>"Darnielle, singer and songwriter for the much-loved bandThe Mountain Goats, cuts right to the chase in his short novel, the blunt,direct tone of his adolescent protagonist Richard Painter perfectlyencapsulating the enduring appeal of metal's great progenitors. It's all aboutthe Mighty Riff when it comes to Sabbath; everything else is secondary, andwhile one could easily make a case for at least half a dozen albums thatdeserve the 33 1/3 treatment, the riffs that define this particular album are,to echo young Roger's sentiment, unfuckwithable." &#x2014;Adrien Begrand, Popmatters.com<br> (Adrien Begrand)<br><br>"Mountain Goat John Darnielle's off-stage literaryproclivities are no secret, which makes us all the more excited for his firstnovel, a paean to Black Sabbath's Master of Reality. The book is the latest in Continuum's 33 1/3series ultrasmart series of elegant, pocket-size appreciations of rock albumsas diverse as the Beatles' Let it Be and My Bloody Valentine's Loveless. Darnielle unpacks the classic, riff-erificalbum as a scrabrous series of diary entries written by a teenager in a Southern California mental institution. Those curious tosee the budding rock critic off-stage or who are simply bonkers for Sabbath areadvised to check out this reading." &#x2014;Tayt Harlin, New YorkMagazine<br>"With his short stories masquerading as songs, JohnDarnielle&#x2014;founding member of the Mountain Goats&#x2014;has crafted a wide range ofoff-kilter characters.

So it's unsurprising that JohnDarnielle can also work up some music-free compositions, like his contributionto Continuum's 33 1/3 series of books inspired by classic albums, a novel aboutBlack Sabbath's 'Master of Reality.' He also recently wrapped up a stint of guest blogging atPowell's excellent blog, which is worth revisiting if you're curious about hisfeelings about heavy metal (he likes it! and is very knowledgable about it!).And if you live in New York,you can come to a reading of the Black Sabbath book next Saturday at HousingWorks and witness his non-singing talents in person." &#x2014;MediaBistro's Galleycat<br>Interviewed by Gothamist</p><h2>Content Strategy Toolkit, The: Methods, Guidelines, and Templates for Getting Content Right (Voices That Matter)</h2><p>In this essential guide, Meghan Casey outlines a step-by-step approach for doing content strategy, from planning and creating your content to delivering and managing it.

What is an apprentice? It is a young person who is learning a skill from a master teacher. Our students will serve as apprentices to the great writers and great stories of history. </p><p> Students are often expected to write with no clear model before them. Modern composition scolds traditional writing instruction as rote and unimaginative. It takes imitation to task for a lack of freedom and personal expression. And yet, effective communication from writer to reader always requires some sort of form and structure. Many of historys greatest writers learned by imitation. In other words, writing takes the same kind of determined study as ballet or diving. Creativity uses conventional form as a stage or a springboard from which to launch grand jet�s and somersaults. Too often students are expected to tackle complex writing assignments without learning the necessary intermediate steps. The assumption is that because most everyone can speak English well enough to be understood, and form letters with a pencil, that everyone should be able to write well. Yet how many of us would expect a child to sit at a piano, without piano lessons, and play a concerto? Writing is never automatic. </p><p> The Writing &amp; Rhetoric series method employs fluent reading, careful listening, models for imitation, and progressive steps. It assumes that students learn best by reading excellent, whole-story examples of literature and by growing their skills through imitation. Each exercise is intended to impart a skill (or tool) that can be employed in all kinds of writing and speaking. The exercises are arranged from simple to more complex. Whats more, the exercises are cumulative, meaning that later exercises incorporate the skills acquired in preceding exercises. This series is a step-by-step apprenticeship in the art of writing and rhetoric. </p><p> The word chreia (cray-a) comes from the Greek word chreiodes (cray-o-dees), which means ''useful.'' It is a short essay or remembrance that praises the author of a saying or proverb and shows why the saying is useful. This book employs all the skills of the preceding books in the series and teaches students how to write a six-paragraph essay on the basis of a saying or an action. The thinking and exercises occur within the framework of the stories which, in this book, include wonderful historical figures such as King Arthur, King Alfred, Lady Godiva, King Canute, Omar Khayyam, and more.</p><p> The six-paragraph essay using the five Ws (who, what, when, where, why) is arranged this way: </p><p> Praise the person or saying of your chreia or proverb<br> Restate the saying in your own words<br> Explain why this is useful<br> Contrast your example with another person in history<br> Compare your example with another similar example in history<br> Epilogue-conclude your essay</p><p>Classical Academic Press </p><p> Educators will find all curricula by Classical Academic Press to be created with four important attributes.

Replacing the familiar lines for "Little Miss Muffet" are the words: "Little Dan Dumper sat on his bumper,/Taking his break for the day./Along came Pete Loader,/who revved his loud motor,/And frightened Dan Dumper away." The words for "Three Blind Mice" change to: "Three LOUD trucks./Three LOUD trucks./See how they ZOOM./See how they ZOOM./They all jumped over/the <i>muck and goo</i>./They skidded and screeched/and their mufflers blew./Did you ever see/such a crazy crew?/As three LOUD trucks./Three LOUD trucks." Fresh noisy lyrics for "The Wheels on the Bus" are great for singing exuberantly in storytime, "The siren on the truck goes whoop, whoop, whoop...." The digital illustrations are colorful, energetic, and playful: the vehicles have personality plus. One flashy spread shows all of them and their sound words from "The Wheels on the Truck," and another picture shows the ice-cream truck parked on a moon made of ice cream. This effervescent picture book will zoom off your shelves.&#x2014;<i>Kirsten Cutler, Sonoma County Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This is the fifth in a series of twelve books that will train students over six years. A refutation is a short essay that attacks certain parts of a narrative. In this book, students will learn to identify and refute, or criticize, parts of a narrative that are unbelievable, improbable, unclear, or improper. A confirmation is a short essay that defends certain parts of a narrative. When students see parts of a narrative that are believable, probable, clear, or proper, they will confirm them. After learning to identify the parts of a story that can be attacked or defended, students will practice writing refutations or confirmations using sound arguments to explain their opinions. Be assured that this exercise of refutation and confirmation is not about taking the magic out of stories. On the contrary, it is designed to help students love truly good stories even more because they will think about them more deeply. As students practice refutation and confirmation in this book, they will not only learn to form arguments and express their opinions, but also to find delight in the stories they read. Students will learn to -Write four-paragraph essays-Outline-Refute or confirm parts of stories-Understand comparison and contrast-Introduce and conclude an essay-Use narrative to further the purpose of exposition-Use direct quotes to support an argument-Deliver writing orally-Revise writing What is the Progymnasmata? Think of the Progymnasmata as a step-by-step apprenticeship in the art of writing and rhetoric. In the Writing &amp; Rhetoric series, author Paul Kortepeter has recovered this proven method of teaching writing in conjunction with critical thinking and speaking. Writing &amp; Rhetoric: Refutation &amp; Confirmation provides students with forms and models of excellent writing that they will imitate as they progress down the path to masterful writing.</p><p>I wanted to thank you all for putting your Writing and Rhetoric curriculum together. My fifth and third grader have just finished up Narrative 1 and I am impressed with how painlessly their writing has improved. I'm also impressed with how they have naturally taken on the voice of the stories they are imitating and how they have merged stories together. My youngest three will definitely be using it all the way through. I wish it had been around for my older kids. It s been awhile since I have been so pleased with a curriculum. Thanks! --Brandie<br><br>My [students] love Writing &amp; Rhetoric. The stories are wonderful and engaging and we have had so much fun with it.

When we started this program, he was producing sentences like: the silly girl laughed a lot. But in our last lesson, he wrote: The dark shaggy monster rose from under the bed, and in a dreadfully fearsome voice started to growl. Now THAT'S a sentence! He completed the Fox and the Grapes fable a while back, and he is still pointing out characters in other stories or even tv shows that are displaying an attitude of sour grapes.

The question goes like this: &#34;Look, I&#39;ve read your book, and it expresses what I have always thought about Christian ministry. But as I kept reading, I had this sinking feeling that what actually happens in our church is still a long way from the kind of disciple-making ministry vision you outline and that I believe in. So my question is this: What can we do about it? How can we shape the whole culture of our church around disciple-making?&#34; In &#34;The Vine Project&#34;, Marshall and Payne provide a roadmap and resources for this sort of church-wide culture change. The book guides your ministry leadership team through a five-phase process for growth and change, with biblical input, practical ideas, resources, case studies, exercises and projects along the way. You will be helped to: clarify and sharpen your convictions (Phase 1) reform your own personal life to express these convictions (Phase 2) honestly evaluate every aspect of your current church (or ministry) culture (Phase 3) devise some key plans for change and put them into effect (Phase 4) keep the momentum going and overcome obstacles (Phase 5). &#34;The Trellis and the Vine&#34; proposed a &#34;ministry mind-shift that changes everything&#34;. &#34;The Vine Project&#34; shows how that mind-shift can and must shape every aspect of what you are doing as a congregation of Christ&#39;s people to make disciples of all nations.

As she did in <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>, Vreeland focuses on a single painting, Auguste Renoir's instantly recognizable masterpiece, which depicts a gathering of Renoir's real friends enjoying a summer Sunday on a caf� terrace along the Seine. Narrated by Renoir and seven of the models, the novel illuminates the gusto, hedonism, and art of the era. With a gorgeous palette of vibrant, captivating characters, Vreeland paints their lives, loves, losses, and triumphs so vividly that "the painting literally comes alive" (<i>The Boston Globe</i>).</p><p><b>Susan Vreeland</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of eight books, including <i>Clara and Mr. Tiffany </i>and<i> Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>. She lives in San Diego.In the style of her earlier work, GIRL IN HYACINTH BLUE, Vreeland revisits the art world--this time the world of the Impressionists, specifically Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This fictionalized account of one of his most famous works is clever and multifaceted. Karen Whites performance is eloquent and sweetly enthusiastic. She pays special attention to the French pronunciations, which are murmured gracefully and without pretension. The narrative has slower moments wherein it seems Vreeland tries too hard to instruct rather than artfully illustrate; regardless, Karen Whites reading is pleasant, and the descriptions are vivid and sparkling. This audiobook makes for good entertainment, transporting the listener to France and teaching a little art history at the same time.

What is the fear of love? It is because when you really love somebody your ego starts slipping away and melting. You cannot love with the ego; the ego becomes a barrier, and when you want to drop the barrier between yourself and the other, the ego says, "This is going to be a death. Beware!"<br><br>The death of the ego is not your death; the death of the ego is really your possibility of life. The ego is just a dead crust around you, it has to be broken and thrown away. It comes into being naturally--just as a traveler collects dust on his clothes, on his body, and he has to take a bath to get rid of the dust. As we move through time, the dust of our experiences, our knowledge, of the life we have lived, of the past, collects. That dust becomes the ego. It accumulates and becomes a crust around you, which has to be broken and thrown away. One has to take a bath every day, in fact every moment, so that this crust never becomes a prison.<br><br>It will be helpful to understand where the ego comes from, to understand the roots.<br><br>A child is born and is absolutely helpless, particularly the human child. He cannot survive without others' help. Most children of the animals, the trees, the birds, can survive without the parents, can survive without a society, without a family. Even if sometimes help is needed, it is very little--a few days, at the most a few months. But a human child is so helpless that he has to depend on others for years. It is there that the root has to be sought.<br><br>Why does helplessness create the human ego? The child is helpless, he depends on others, but the ignorant mind of the child interprets this dependence as if he is the center of the whole world. The child thinks, "Whenever I cry, my mother runs immediately; whenever I am hungry, I just have to give an indication and the breast is given. Whenever I am wet, just a slight cry and somebody comes and changes my clothes." The child lives like an emperor. In fact he is absolutely helpless and dependent, and the mother and father, the family and his caretakers, are all helping him to survive. They are not dependent on the child, the child is dependent on them. But the mind of the child interprets this as if he is the center of the whole world, as if the whole world exists just for him.<br><br>And the world of the child is, of course, very small in the beginning. It consists of the mother, the caretaker, the father on the fringe--this is the child's whole world. These people love the child. And the child becomes more and more egoistic. He feels himself to be the very center of all existence, and in that way the ego is created. Through dependence and helplessness, the ego is created.<br><br>In fact the child's real situation is just the contrary from what he thinks; there is no real justification to create such an ego. But the child is absolutely ignorant, he is not capable of understanding the complexity of the thing. He cannot know that he is helpless, he thinks he is the dictator! And then for his whole life he will try to remain the dictator. He will become a Napoleon, an Alexander, an Adolf Hitler--your presidents, prime ministers, dictators, are all childish. They are trying to achieve the same thing they experienced as children; they want to be the center of the whole existence. With them the world should live and die; the whole world is their periphery and they are the center of it; the very meaning of life is hidden in them.<br><br>The child, of course, naturally finds this interpretation correct, because when the mother looks at him, in the eyes of the mother he sees that he is the significance of her life. When the father comes home, the child feels that he is the very meaning of the father's life. This lasts for three or four years--and the years at the beginning of life are the most important; never again will there be a time in a person's life with the same potential.<br><br>Psychologists say that after the first four years the child is almost complete. The whole pattern is fixed; throughout the rest of life you will repeat the same pattern in different situations. And by the seventh year the child has all his attitudes confirmed, his ego is settled. Now he moves out into the world--and then everywhere he encounters problems, millions of problems! Once you are out of the circle of the family, problems will arise--because nobody else bothers about you in the same way your mother bothered about you; nobody is as concerned about you as your father was. Instead, everywhere you find indifference, and the ego is hurt.<br><br>But now the pattern is set. Whether it hurts or not, the child cannot change the pattern--it has become the very blueprint of his being. He will play with other children and try to dominate them. He will go to school and try to dominate, to come first in his class, to become the most important student. He might believe he is superior but he finds that all the other children believe the same way. There is conflict, there are egos, there is fighting, struggle.<br><br>Then this becomes the whole story of life: there are millions of egos around you, just like yours, and everybody is trying to control, maneuver, dominate--through wealth, power, politics, knowledge, strength, lies, pretensions, hypocrisies. Even in religion and morality, everybody is trying to dominate, to show the rest of the world that "I am the center of the world."<br><br>This is the root of all problems between people. Because of this concept, you are always in conflict and struggle with somebody or other. Not that others are enemies to you--everybody else is just like you, in the same boat. The situation is the same for everybody else; they have been brought up in the same way.<br><br>There exists a certain school of psychoanalysts in the West who have proposed that unless children are brought up without their fathers and mothers, the world will never be at peace. I don't support them, because then children will never be brought up in any way! Those psychologists have something of truth in their proposal, but it is a very dangerous idea. Because if children are brought up in nurseries without fathers and mothers, without any love, with total indifference, they may not have the problems of the ego but they will have other, even more damaging and dangerous problems.<br><br>If a child is brought up in total indifference he will have no center. He will be a hotchpotch, clumsy, not knowing who he is. He will not have any identity. Afraid, scared, he will not be able to take even a single step without fear, because nobody has loved him. Of course, the ego will not be there, but without it he will have no center. He will not become a buddha; he will be just dull and crippled, always feeling afraid.<br><br>Love is needed to make you feel fearless, to make you feel that you are accepted, that you are not useless, that you cannot be discarded in the junkyard. If children are brought up in a situation where love is lacking, they will not have egos, that's true. Their life will not have so much struggle and fight. But they will not be able to stand up for themselves at all. They will be always in flight, escaping from everybody, hiding in caves in their own being. They will not be buddhas, they will not be radiant with vitality, they will not be centered, at ease, at home. They will simply be eccentric, off-center. That will not be a good situation either.<br><br>So I don't support these psychologists. Their approach would create robots, not human beings--and robots of course have no problems. Or, they may create human beings who are more like animals. There will be less anxiety, less ulcers, less cancer, but that is not worth achieving when it means that you cannot grow to a higher peak of consciousness. Instead you would be falling downward; it will be a regression. Of course, if you become an animal there will be less anguish, because there will be less consciousness. And if you become a stone, a rock, there will be no anxiety at all because there is nobody inside to feel anxious, to feel anguish. But this is not worth achieving. One has to be like a god, not like a rock. And by that I mean it to have absolute consciousness and still have no worries, no anxieties, no problems; to enjoy life like the birds, to celebrate life like birds, to sing like birds--not through regression but by growing to the optimum of consciousness.<br><br>The child gathers ego--it is natural, nothing can be done about it. One has to accept it. But later on, there is no need to keep carrying it. That ego is needed in the beginning for the child to feel that he is accepted, loved, welcomed--that he is an invited guest, not an accident. The father, the mother, the family, and the warmth around the child help him to grow strong, rooted, grounded. It is needed, the ego gives him protection--it is good, it is just like the shell of a seed. But the shell should not become the ultimate thing, otherwise the seed will die. The protection can go on too long, then it becomes a prison. The protection must remain a protection while it is needed, and when the moment comes for the hard shell of the seed to die into the earth, it should die naturally so that the seed can sprout and life can be born.<br><br>The ego is just a protective shell--the child needs it because he is helpless. The child needs it because he is weak; the child needs it because he is vulnerable and there are millions of forces all around. He needs protection, a home, a base. The whole world may be indifferent but he can always look toward home, and from there he can gather significance.<br><br>But, with significance comes the ego. The child becomes egoistic, and with this ego arise all the problems you face. This ego will not allow you to fall in love. This ego would like everybody to surrender to you; it will not allow you to surrender to anybody--and love happens only when you surrender. When you force somebody else to surrender it is hateful, destructive. It is not love. And if there is no love, your life will be without warmth, without any poetry in it. It may be prose, mathematical, logical, rational. But how can one live without poetry?<br><br>Prose is okay, rationality is okay, it is utilitarian, needed--but living just through reason and logic can never be a celebration, can never be festive. And when life is not festive, it is boring. Poetry is needed--but for poetry you need surrender. You need to throw off this ego. If you can do it, if you can put it aside even for a few moments, your life will have glimpses of the beautiful, of the divine.<br><br>Without poetry you cannot really live, you can only exist. Love is poetry. And if love is not possible, how can you be prayerful, meditative, aware? It becomes almost impossible. And without a meditative awareness, you will remain just a body; you will never become aware of the innermost soul. Only in prayerfulness, in a deep meditation and silence do you reach the peaks. That prayerful silence, that meditative awareness is the highest peak of experience--but love opens the door.<br><br>Carl Gustav Jung, after a lifetime of studying thousands of people--thousands of cases of people who were ill, psychologically crippled, psychologically confused--said that he had never come across a psychologically ill person whose real problem after the fortieth year is not spiritual. There is a rhythm in life, and in your forties a new dimension arises, the spiritual dimension. If you cannot tackle it rightly, if you don't know what to do, you will become ill, you will become restless. The whole of human growth is a continuity. If you miss one step, it becomes discontinuous. The child gathers ego--and if he never learns to put the ego aside he cannot love, cannot be at ease with anybody. The ego will be constantly in fight. You may be sitting silently, but the ego is constantly fighting, just looking out for ways to dominate, to be dictatorial, to become the ruler of the world.<br><br>This creates problems everywhere. In friendship, sex, love, in the society--everywhere you are in conflict. There is even conflict with the parents who have given this ego to you. It is rare that a son forgives his father, rare that a woman forgives her mother. It happens very rarely.<br><br>George Gurdjieff had a sentence on the wall of the room where he used to meet with people. The sentence was this: "If you are not yet at ease with your father and mother, then go away. I cannot help you." Why? Because the problem has arisen there and it has to be solved there. That's why all the old traditions say love your parents, respect your parents as deeply as possible--because the ego arises there, that is the soil. Solve it there, otherwise it will haunt you everywhere.<br><br>Psychoanalysts have also come to the conclusion that all they do is bring you back to the problems that existed between you and your parents and try to solve them somehow. If you can solve your conflict with your parents, many other conflicts will simply disappear because they are based on the same fundamental conflict.<br><br>For example, a man who is not at ease with his father cannot be at ease with the boss in the office--never, because the boss is a father figure. That small conflict with your parents continues to be reflected in all your relationships. If you are not at ease with your mother, you cannot be at ease with your wife because she will be the representative woman; you cannot be at ease with women as such, because your mother is the first woman, she is the first model of a woman. Wherever a woman is, your mother is, and a subtle relationship continues.<br><br>Ego is born in the relationship with the father and mother, and it has to be tackled there. Otherwise you will go on cutting branches and leaves of the tree, and the root remains untouched.</p><h2>Jazz Guitar Single Note Soloing, Volume 1</h2><p>A book that clearly explains the principles of jazz soloing.

John Doe of the legendary band X and co-author Tom DeSavia have woven together an enthralling story of the legendary West Coast scene from 1977-1982 by enlisting the voices of people who were there. The book shares chapter-length tales from the authors along with personal essays from famous (and infamous) players in the scene.

His father was an architect and his mother whodied when he was ten years old was the daughter of a notable watercolorist. It was she who firstencouraged young Ernest to paint and draw. Art became Ernest's passion, and after attendingHeatherly's Art School and the Royal Acadamy Schools, Shepard supported himself by drawingfor the illustrated papers and by illustrating books.<br><br>In 1903, Shepard married Florence Chaplin. Florence was a mural painter and fellow student atthe Academy. The Shepards had two children: Graham, who was killed in World War II, andMary, who later illustrated Mary L. Travers Mary Poppins books.<br><br>When World War I broke out, Shepard served in France, Belgium, and Italy, attaining the rank ofMajor. On his return to England, he continued with his art. He became a regular contributor toPunch, the classic British humor magazine, where he met A. A. Milne, a man who was to beinstrumental to his career. Shepard was elected to the editorial board of Punch, and shortlythereafter, he agreed to do the illustrations for Milne's first book of verse, When We Were VeryYoung.<br><br>The illustrations that Shepard created for all four of the Pooh books received worldwide acclaim.For the next thirty years, he continued to illustrate books for both adults and children. In 1973,for the first time, he added color to his drawings for Winnie-the-Pooh. Shepard ultimately donatedseveral hundred drawings to the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.<br>Ernest H.

As she runs home, oblivious to what is happening, the words escape. While a fox nets the jumbled letters, readers can discern "once upon a time," "wizard," "bears," etc. At home, the child is disappointed, thinking the book lacks a story. Then she hears the whisper: "You can imagine the words...the stories....There are never any rules...imagining just is." She develops an approach, looking more closely at the pictures and asking herself questions from her vantage point at the border. Ironically, this is not a wordless experience for readers; the girl develops opening sentences for the next seven magical compositions. Zagarenski's signature wheels, teacups, crowns, and tigers populate these richly layered, golden scenes, full of texture and mystery: an elephant and lion float by on a quest, a wizard blows bubbles that become real creatures. During the girl's return trip to school, the fox requests help reaching grapes. Those familiar with Aesop may be surprised that no trickery is involved. The endpapers reveal the edited fable; the listening fox has also learned about imagining and reimagining. Stories about storytelling can be hard sells to children, who generally prefer the familiar arc of a sustained narrative. However, the mixed-media art is so stunning in this Caldecott-honor artist's first foray into writing that they will make an exception. VERDICT A sumptuously illustrated fable about the magic of storytelling and the power of imagination.&#x2014;Wendy Lukehart, District of Columbia Public Library</p><h2>The Art of Fact: A Historical Anthology of Literary Journalism</h2><p>Learn how to be the best journalist you can be with what &#x201c;could be the world&#x2019;s most readable textbook&#x201d; (<i>Time Out New York</i>).<br><br><i>The Art of Fact </i>is a historical treasury tracing literary journalism back to such pioneers as Defoe, Dickens, and Orwell, and to crime writers, investigative social reporters, and war correspondents who stretched the limits of style and even propriety to communicate powerful truth. Here an extraordinary range of styles&#x2014;the elegance of Gay Talese, the militance of Marvel Cooke, the station-house cynicism of David Simon, the manic intelligence of Richard Ben Cramer&#x2014;illuminates an extraordinary range of subjects. From large public events (Jimmy Breslin on the funeral of JFK) to small private moments (Gary Smith on the struggles of a Native American basketball player), these readings&#x2014;sad, funny, and most of all provocative&#x2014;offer the double pleasure of true stories artfully told.</p><p>Kevin Kerrane and Ben Yagoda, journalists and journalism teachers, saw a need for a textbook that celebrated and organized outstanding examples of literary journalism. In this compendious volume spanning 372 years, the editors focus on the evolution of New Journalism, a term which, we learn, "was originally coined by Matthew Arnold in 1887 to describe the style of Stead's <i>Pall Mall Gazette</i>: brash, vivid, personal, reform-minded, and--occasionally, from Arnold's conservative viewpoint--'featherbrained.'" <p> The editors position Daniel Defoe's <i>The True and Genuine Account of the Life and Actions of the Late Jonathan Wild</i> (1725) as the prototype for the true-crime narrative. The collection's first section, entitled "Pioneers," includes such staples as Boswell's <i>Life of Samuel Johnson</i>, Walt Whitman's <i>Specimen Days</i>, and Jack London's daring 1902 expos� of life among the city of London's impoverished East Enders. Brief introductions to each selection set the historical context and explain innovative aspects of the piece. The second section compares two distinctly contemporary journalistic points of view: the "I Am a Camera" school and the unabashedly subjective approach exemplified by Norman Mailer and Hunter S. Thompson, among others. "Style as Substance" makes up the lively and often moving third section. </p><p> Many rich voices describe all angles of the human experience in this impressive volume. Through author Piers Paul Read we crash-land with a Uruguayan rugby team in the Andes; Lillian Ross gives us a notoriously devastating portrait of Ernest Hemingway; Ted Conover assimilates into illegal Mexican culture and smuggles us back and forth across the border. The only anthology of its kind, <i>The Art of Fact</i> almost doubles as a travel book.</p>Kerrane, author of books about baseball, and Yagoda, author of a biography of Will Rogers, both teach courses on literary journalism, an endeavor that inspired their compilation of this distinctive and enjoyable anthology of, to use their definition, "thoughtfully, artfully, and valuably innovative" journalism. Kerrane and Yagoda have narrowed the broad category of creative nonfiction to writing that is literary in quality but strictly factual in content, as opposed to more impressionistic essays and memoirs. They discuss the finer points of literary journalism in their sharp and informative preface, then present an edifying array of sterling examples, ranging from works by such pioneers as Daniel Defoe, Stephen Crane, and Jack London to works by Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, Hunter S. Thompson, and John McPhee. The selection of confident and sometimes riling voices is matched by an enlivening diversity of subject matter, from politics to sports, nature, war, and crime, a wealth guaranteed to broaden readers' perception of literary journalism and establish appropriately high standards for this vital genre. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Respectful Parents, Respectful Kids: 7 Keys to Turn Family Conflict into Cooperation</h2><p>More than a tool to correct bad behavior, this handbook&nbsp;urges parents to move beyond typical discipline techniques by creating an environment based on mutual respect, emotional safety, and positive, open communication.

Ralph Cosham's voice is indifferent to the adventures he is reading. There is no indication of when one story stops and another begins. Character differentiation is also confusing, leaving the listener thoroughly frustrated.

Initially planned in 1890 around a memorial to Robert E. Lee, over the next four decades the avenue evolved into a parade of statues honoring heroes of the Confederacy. In the mid-1990s, however, the dedication of a controversial memorial to African American tennis player Arthur Ashe signaled that Monument Avenue's meaning had broadened beyond commemorating the Lost Cause. <br><br>This book traces the history of Monument Avenue, of its buildings and statuary, and of the people who helped create one of America's great streets. Enriched by more than three hundred photographs, plans, and drawings, it chronicles the avenue's development, captures architectural details and city preservation efforts, and places the avenue's story in local, regional, and national context.<br><br>Built to reflect the hopes and attitudes of Richmonders at the turn of the last century, Monument Avenue exists nearly intact today as the centerpiece of a flourishing neighborhood, even as its meaning continues to be redefined.<br><br></p><p>" <i>Richmond's Monument Avenue</i> is a beautifully illustrated, meticulously researched, and well-written book."-- <i>Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians</i> <br>Sarah Shields Driggs is an independent architectural historian and consultant who lives in Richmond.<br><br>Richard Guy Wilson is chair and Commonwealth Professor of Architectural History at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.<br><br>Robert P.

It articulates the unifying theoretical framework and explores the centrality of consciousness for both theory and practice. It reviews the major transpersonal models of psychotherapy, including Wilber, Jung, Washburn, Grof, Ali, and existential, psychoanalytic,and body-centered approaches, and assesses the strengths and limitations of each. The book also examines the key clinical issues in the field. It concludes by synthesizing some of the overarching principles of transpersonal psychotherapy as they apply to actual clinical work.</p><p><p>At the California Institute of Integral Studies, Brant Cortright is Professor of Psychology and Chair of the Integral Counseling Psychology program. He is the author of Integral Psychology: Yoga, Growth, and Opening the Heart, also published by SUNY Press.</p>"The field of transpersonal psychotherapy is growing rapidly and needs a competent overview and assessment of perspectives. Psychotherapy and Spirit meets this need. My guess is that it will be widely consulted not only by transpersonal psychotherapists but also by psychotherapists of other orientations who are open to the spiritual dimension of the psychotherapeutic process." --Michael Washburn, author of The Ego and the Dynamic Ground, Transpersonal Psychology in Psychoanalytic Perspective<br><br>"Cortright brings together the disparate elements of transpersonal psychology in a way that is unique and profound. I know of no other work that so compellingly summarizes the progress and controversies within this groundbreaking discipline." -- John E. Nelson, M.D., author of Healing the Split: Integrating Spirit Into Our Understanding of the Mentally Ill<br><br>"This material is central in the training of transpersonal therapists and in the continuing education of more traditionally oriented psychotherapists. Clearly the author's convictions and experience inspire the book, and it will resonate with other clinicians attempting to do transpersonal therapy." -- Arlene Mazak, Institute of Transpersonal Psychology</p><h2>Two Treatises of Government and A Letter Concerning Toleration</h2><p><b>Two of Locke&#x2019;s most mature and influential political writings and three brilliant interpretive essays combined in an outstanding new volume</b><br><br> Among the most influential writings in the history of Western political thought, John Locke&#x2019;s <i>Two Treatises of Government </i>and<i> A Letter Concerning Toleration</i> remain<i></i>vital to political debates today, more than three centuries after they were written. The complete texts appear in this volume, accompanied by interpretive essays by three prominent Locke scholars. Ian Shapiro&#x2019;s introduction places Locke&#x2019;s political writings in historical and biographical context. John Dunn explores both the intellectual context in which Locke wrote the <i>Two Treatises of Government </i>and<i> A Letter Concerning Toleration </i>and<i></i>the major interpretive controversies surrounding their meaning. Ruth Grant offers a comprehensive discussion of Locke&#x2019;s views on women and the family, and Shapiro contributes an essay on the democratic elements of Locke&#x2019;s political theory. Taken together, the texts and essays in this volume offer invaluable insights into the history of ideas and the enduring influence of Locke&#x2019;s political thought.</p><p>Rethinking the Western Tradition Series<b>Ian Shapiro </b>is William R.

It started slowly: backing away from birthday parties, avoiding the Fourth of July fireworks, leaving before the end of movies. By second grade, stomach aches and tantrums before school seemed as common as strawberry jelly on toast. Then, just before her fourth grade chorus concert&#x2014;as her mom was braiding her hair&#x2014;Casey puked. No concert. No post-concert ice cream with her friends. Only a night filled with tears. Everything changed that next morning. Casey and her mom had had enough! The days of being timid were over. They got mad and decided then and there to solve the puzzle called worry. Casey expresses a serious commitment to the task, but couples it with feisty, irreverent humor, as she releases a gaggle of characters and their stories. The narrative offers cautious kids (and their sometimes worried, often frustrated parents) a realistic guide for stepping into the new and scary experiments that arrive at each developmental stage, right up through the teen years. Will her frightful encounter with the snarling dog keep her forever from walking to the bus stop, or the ominous storm clouds end her fun at the water park? Will an asparagus-dog with cheese get her into the clubhouse-building project? Can you really talk to your worry like it&#x2019;s a squirrel?

Sixteen months later, however, he was dismissed from the pulpit after being accused of engaging in homosexual relations with two boys. After his dismissal, Alger began to focus on his writing career, which spanned more than three decades and 110 books. He wrote mainly children's books about boys and girls who rise from rags to riches through hard work and faith in the American dream.

Now he has done the same thing for the public at large, in an extraordinary book that is a new kind of architectural history."<br> This magisterial work has now been revised and expanded by Greg Castillo, Kostof's colleague and literary executor. Insightful, engagingly written, and graced with almost a thousand superb illustrations, the Second Edition of this classic volume offers a sweeping narrative that examines architecture as it reflects the social, economic, and technological systems of human history. The scope of the book is astonishing. No mere survey of famous buildings, Kostof's <em>History</em> examines a surprisingly wide variety of manmade structures: prehistoric huts and the TVA, the pyramids at Giza and the Rome railway station, the ziggurat and the department store. Indeed, Kostof considered every building worthy of attention, every structure or shelter a potential source of insight, whether it be the prehistoric hunting camps at Terra Amata, or the caves at Lascaux with their magnificent paintings, or a twenty-story hotel on the Las Vegas strip. The Second Edition features a new concluding chapter, "Designing the Fin de Si�cle," based on Kostof's last lecture notes and prepared by Castillo, as well as an all-new 16-page color section. Many of the original line drawings by Richard Tobias, as well as some 50 photographs, have also been updated or replaced, for improved clarity. <br> Visually and intellectually stimulating, this book is at once a compelling history and an indispensable reference on all aspects of our built environment. It achieves for architecture what Janson's history accomplished for visual art.</p><p>Pulls together the work of a multitude of scholars into a workable synthesis that will be of value to college students who are just becoming acquainted with the area of study...Kostof has achieved a synthesis of sound scholarship, up-to-date interpretation, and excellent analysis for which he and his publisher are to be congratulated.<br><strong>Spiro Kostof</strong> was Professor of Architectural History at the University of California at Berkeley, and was a former president of the Society of Architectural Historians. <strong>Greg Castillo</strong> was Kostof's research assistant and literary executor.<br></p><h2>The Greco-Persian Wars</h2><p>This is a reissue, with a new introduction and an update to the bibliography, of the original edition, published in 1970 as The Year of Salamis<i> in England and as </i>Xerxes at Salamis<i> in the U.S.<br><br>The long and bitter struggle between the great Persian Empire and the fledgling Greek states reached its high point with the extraordinary Greek victory at Salamis in 480 B.C. The astonishing sea battle banished forever the specter of Persian invasion and occupation. Peter Green brilliantly retells this historic moment, evoking the whole dramatic sweep of events that the Persian offensive set in motion. The massive Greek victory, despite the Greeks' inferior numbers, opened the way for the historic evolution of the Greek states in a climate of creativity, independence, and democracy, one that provided a model and an inspiration for centuries to come.<br><br>Green's accounts of both Persian and Greek strategies are clear and persuasive; equally convincing are his everyday details regarding the lives of soldiers, statesmen, and ordinary citizens. He has first-hand knowledge of the land and sea he describes, as well as full command of original sources and modern scholarship. With a new foreword, <i>The Greco-Persian Wars</i> is a book that lovers of fine historical writing will greet with pleasure.</i></p><p>Popular classicist Peter Green (author of <i>Alexander of Macedon, 356-323 B.C.</i>) offers an engrossing narrative of the wars between the Greeks and the Persians. This is real David-and-Goliath material, with the scrappy, feuding city-states of ancient Greece fending off a much larger aggressor. The conflicts themselves are a kind of struggle for the soul of Western civilization: "On the one side, the towering, autocratic figure of the Great King; on the other, the voluntary and imperfect discipline of proudly independent citizens." The Greeks surprisingly fare better in these encounters, and make themselves legends on the plains of Marathon (192 Greek casualties versus 6,400 Persians), during the heroic last stand at Thermopylae, and elsewhere.<p> <i>The Greco-Persian Wars</i> is full of wonderful stories featuring bravery, cowardice, and treachery. Unlike so many of his fellow historians, Green understands the importance of a dramatic narrative, sometimes employing novelistic techniques to relate what happened. It's not an overstatement to say that the course of Western history might have taken a strikingly unfamiliar turn if these battles had had different outcomes. Green is a natural storyteller, and <i>The Greco-Persian Wars</i> is a delight to read, even for readers who have no background or special interest in the classical world. <i>--John J. Miller</i></p>"Peter Green's <i>The Year of Salamis</i> is deservedly famous, combining scholarship and imagination with the ability to tell a stirring tale."&#x2015;J. F.

He is the former editor of <i>CadCam International,</i> and author of <i>Drawing for 3-Dimensional Design</i> and <i>Production for Graphic Designers 3e.</i> </p><p> </p> <i>"Reason informed by emotion... expressed in beauty... elevated by earnestness... lightened by humor... that is the ideal that should guide all artists."</i><br> &#x2013; CHARLES RENNIE MACKINTOSH <p></p> <p> What is art? Art is what artists do, Dadaist Marcel Duchamp might have said. Art is what you can get away with, you may be tempted to think when looking at contemporary artworks. The word art derives from Sanskrit and means "making" or "creating something". We can only guess why our earliest ancestors started to make art, drawing and carving on cave walls. Egyptian wall paintings and African art have a ritual dimension, but still manage to delight our eyes. The ancient Greeks and Romans surrounded their lives with culture: poetry, theater, sculptures-and paintings, few of which survive. They were probably the first artists who painted purely for pleasure and for the joy their art gave others. Whatever the reasons for creating, art enriches our lives, stimulates our senses, or simply makes us think. Artists have come to be revered for their gift of profound insight into the human condition. </p> <p> In Byzantine and Renaissance times, being an artist was just a job: painters had workshops full of assistants, and artisans making paint and preparing panels and canvases. They generally produced religious artworks for wealthy patrons. It was only in the late nineteenth century that "art for art's sake" began to emerge, art being seen as an expression of the artist's emotions. Since then Hollywood has depicted such artists as Vincent van Gogh and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec as glamorous yet tortured visionaries who suffered for their art, locked away in solitary garrets. Abstract art followed, and today almost anything goes. </p> <p> What is design? Its roots are found in the Italian word disegnare, to create. In these days of designer jeans and kitchens, it is easy to think of design equating to stylish consumer goods or gadgets, made desirable by clever and knowing graphics (which draw ultimately on art for inspiration). We can forget that everything artificial&#x2014;good or bad&#x2014;has been designed by someone. </p> <p> In its broadest sense, design is preparing for action: planning and organizing. We might have "designs" on someone, and plan how we can engineer a successful outcome. Architects design buildings, industrial designers design products, and artists design paintings and sculptures. This book looks at design in the easel-based arts, with references to the allied arts of photography and sculpture. By easel arts we mean drawing, painting, and printmaking, in the sense of making marks on paper or canvas, or the screen-based arts: video, computer, and installation-based works. The computer has blurred the boundaries between the traditional creative disciplines, but they all share a need for planning and visual organization. </p> <p> Design can also be considered as a form of problem-solving. But unlike math, in art there is never a single correct solution. This is why artists and designers are often called "creatives." Painters and sculptors often set their own tasks; designers and illustrators are given a brief with strictly defined parameters, and attempt a design based on those constraints. Even in abstract expressionism, where you might imagine that all the artist does is throw a pot of paint at the canvas and hope for the best, there are underlying processes at work. The artist's eye and hand in tandem are guided by a need to produce an outcome, and he or she is informed by the whole history of art up until that point. Chance and randomness do have a place, but serendipity is a better term: you need skill and experience to turn a happy accident to your advantage. </p> <p> It is beyond the scope of this book to provide a comprehensive overview of art history, but there are plenty of other books and web resources&#x2014;some of which are listed toward the end of this book, should you be inspired to explore further. Nor can this book be an art appreciation guide, although understanding how and why artworks were created, what the artists were trying to achieve, and who their influences were will pay dividends when planning your own works. Looking should be the main education of every artist. </p> <p> Design in the context of this book means, simply, composition. How do we place and arrange the various elements of design discussed in Part 1&#x2014;of little use on their own-to create a unified and thoughtful piece of work that will interest the viewer? The way in which to go about this, using rules or principles, is outlined in Part 2. The many illustrations serve as examples, and as inspiration. Although the chapters are set out in a logical sequence, it is almost impossible to isolate a particular element&#x2014;discussing line, for example-without mentioning its textural component. There will be some repetition and overlap, but perhaps the reader will recognize that all the elements and principles of design are equally important, and, once joined together in the right combination, they will result in a successful artwork. We describe them; how they are used is up to you. </p> <p> Many people have contributed to the creation of this book. I should like to thank in particular Lee Greenfield for commissioning me to write it, my editor Richard Mason for his patience and eye for detail, my picture researcher Sue Bolsom for her tireless work and lateral thinking, and the designer Ian Hunt for assembling words and images into a harmonious composition. I should also like to thank friends and colleagues of the Brighton Illustrators Group, many of whom have contributed images, and the staff of Brighton University Library at St. Peter's House and of Brighton Public Library for their help in research. </p> <p> Alan Pipes, July 2003 </p></p><h2>Moral Choices: An Introduction to Ethics</h2><p>Moral Choices helps college students form a sound basis for making ethical decisions in today&#39;s complex postmodern culture. This book grounds students in both the theory of ethics and its application to today&#39;s pressing social issues. Avoiding undue dogmatism, Professor Scott B. Rae outlines the distinctive elements of Christian ethics. He also introduces students to various ethical systems and their key historical proponents, including Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, and Kant. And, after describing a seven-step procedure for tackling ethical dilemmas, he uses case studies to address the current issues listed below. Now in its second edition, Moral Choices is expanded and revised to provide the most current insights. Topics include: Abortion Reproductive Technologies Euthanasia Capital Punishment Sexual Ethics The Morality of War The Legislation of Morality New: Genetic Technologies and Human Cloning Besides the new chapter, substantial changes have been made in the chapters on euthanasia and reproductive technologies.</p><p>Scott B. Rae (PhD, University of Southern California) is professor of Christian ethics at Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, La Mirada, California.CHRISTIAN ETHICS Despite modern departures from it, the Judeo-Christian system of morality has had a profound impact on society from its inception. In this chapter we will put forth the various emphases in Christian ethics and address some of the criticisms of Christian ethics. Initially, we will establish a scriptural foundation by examining various points of ethical emphasis in both Old and New Testaments. Although both Old and New Testament ethics are vast subjects on which entire volumes have been written, a synthesis of the major emphases in biblical ethics is all that space here will allow. Much of biblical ethics revolves around God&#39;s specially revealed commands. For many people, therefore, the divine command theory of ethics has become synonymous with biblical ethics. Such a theory of ethics, however, raises questions about whether something is good because God commanded it or whether God commands something because it is good. This is known as the &#39;Euthyphro dilemma,&#39; since the question was first raised by Plato in his dialogue Euthyphro. This dilemma cannot be adequately addressed without a consideration of what is called natural law. Previously emphasized primarily by Roman Catholics and at times treated with scorn by Protestants, this concept is important for a fully developed biblical ethic. Its definition and biblical justification will be explored toward the end of this chapter. OLD TESTAMENT ETHICS Just as the Old Testament is not a systematic theology but a mixture of different theological emphases presented in a variety of literary styles, so too, the Old Testament is not a carefully arranged system of ethics, but a mixture of different types of moral reasoning. The Old Testament reflects great diversity in methods of moral reasoning. With the Mosaic Law providing the ethical principles by which Israel ordered its life, it is not surprising that deontology, or an appeal to principles, is strongly emphasized in the Old Testament. In their appeal to the Law as the basis of their prophetic message, the prophets depend heavily on deontology. But there is more to morality in the Old Testament than the simple appeal to principles and commands. The Wisdom Literature contains a measure of utilitarian reasoning. For example, many of the Proverbs contain explicit descriptions of the consequences of certain actions and character traits. The writers of the Proverbs appear to praise wisdom because of the good consequences it produces, while they warn against folly because of the harmful consequences that it produces. To be sure, the Wisdom Literature is ultimately grounded in the Law, and thus ultimately grounded in principles. The Wisdom Literature, then, does not attempt to use utilitarianism as a self-sufficient system for discovering morality, but the appeal to principles is supplemented by appeal to consequences, a use of both utilitarian and deontological methods. The Old Testament also appeals to egoism and self-interest, specifically in the covenant blessings and cursings in Deuteronomy 27-30. Here God reveals to Moses that Israel&#39;s agriculture and national security face certain consequences dependent on her obedience to the covenant. Thus her loyalty to the covenant will result in certain blessings, while her disobedience will lead to certain cursings. Accordingly, Israel would have a high degree of self-interest to obey the Law. The prophets repeatedly refer to the blessings and cursings of the covenant in their attempts to call Israel back to faithfulness to God, suggesting that the covenant cursings and blessings form a significant aspect of Old Testament ethics. Again, this is not to say that Scripture uses egoism as a self-sufficient ethical system, but rather, that the appeal to principles is supplemented by an appeal to self-interest. Finally, the Old Testament also appeals to natural law. For example, the book of Proverbs defines right and wrong (wisdom and folly) by observations drawn from nature (Prov. 6:6-11; see also Ps. 19:1-6) and human relationships (Prov. 24:30-34). Natural law is not strictly limited to observations from nature, however. It refers to universal moral principles that are not specifically derived from special revelation. The oracles to the nations (e.g., see Isa. 13-23; Jer. 46-51; Ezek. 25-32) are good examples of biblical appeal to natural law. Unlike Israel who had the Mosaic Law, these nations lacked the Law and are still condemned for many of the same transgressions as Israel, including injustice, violence, and oppression of the poor. We can conclude, therefore, that these nations were somehow aware of their crimes, otherwise God could not be just in holding them accountable for their crimes. The means by which God made them aware of these moral obligations is general revelation, or natural law. Thus in the Old Testament natural law supplements the ethics provided by special revelation.1 THE LAW AS THE CORE OF OLD TESTAMENT ETHICS The foundation of Old Testament ethics is the Law. Some scholars use the term Law more narrowly to refer to the Ten Commandments (Ex. 20:1-7; Deut. 5:1-21). We will use it more broadly to refer to the first five books of the Old Testament, the Pentateuch, but especially to the material found in Exodus 20-40, Leviticus, and Deuteronomy 5-30. The Law sets out the fundamental principles and commands for Israel and consists of three primary parts: (1) the moral law, or the Ten Commandments; (2) the civil law, which governed social relations and institutions; and (3) the ceremonial law, which governed Israel&#39;s worship of God. When referring to Old Testament ethics, most scholars use the moral and civil law as the foundation. The ceremonial law is often considered a part of Israel&#39;s religious ritual, and not strictly related to ethics. Much of the remainder of the Old Testament ethics can be seen in relation to the Law. In the Poetic Literature, especially Psalms, worship is often presented as a response to the revelation of God in the Law. The Wisdom Literature attempts to take the general demands of the Law and make them persuasive to an international audience, without any of the features directly related to Israel, such as the sacrificial system, the Promised Land, the covenants, and the tabernacle or temple. The Prophets appeal to the Law as their primary point of reference in making their indictments against Israel.</p><h2>A Merry Christmas: And Other Christmas Stories (Penguin Christmas Classics)</h2><p><b>One of six beloved Christmas classics in collectible hardcover editions</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><i>A Merry Christmas</i> collects the treasured holiday tales of Louisa May Alcott, from the dearly familiar Yuletide benevolence of Marmee and her &#x201c;little women&#x201d; to the timeless &#x201c;What Love Can Do,&#x201d; wherein the residents of a boarding house come together to make a lovely Christmas for two poor girls.

Her family later moved to Concord, Massachusetts, where Alcott was influenced by their neighbors Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David Thoreau. At a young age, Louisa took on some of the family&#x2019;s financial burdens, working as a domestic, a teacher, and a writer. In 1868 and 1869, fame and fortune came with the publication of<i> Little Women</i>.

No stockings hung at the fireplace, and for a moment she felt as much disappointment as she did long ago, when her little sock fell down because it was so crammed with goodies. Then she remembered her mother&#x2019;s promise, and slipping her hand under her pillow, drew out a little crimson-covered book. She knew it very well, for it was that beautiful old story of the best life ever lived, and Jo felt that it was a true guidebook for any pilgrim going the long journey. She woke Meg with a &#x201c;Merry Christmas&#x201d; and bade her see what was under her pillow. A green-covered book appeared, with the same picture inside, and a few words written by their mother, which made their one present very precious in their eyes. Presently Beth and Amy woke, to rummage and find their little books also&#x2014;one dove-colored, the other blue; and all sat looking at and talking about them, while the East grew rosy with the coming day.</p><p>In spite of her small vanities, Margaret had a sweet and pious nature, which unconsciously influenced her sisters, especially Jo, who loved her very tenderly, and obeyed her because her advice was so gently given.</p><p>&#x201c;Girls,&#x201d; said Meg, seriously, looking from the tumbled head beside her to the two little nightcapped ones in the room beyond, &#x201c;Mother wants us to read and love and mind these books, and we must begin at once. We used to be faithful about it; but since father went away, and all this war trouble unsettled us, we have neglected many things. You can do as you please; but <i>I</i> shall keep my book on the table here, and read a little every morning as soon as I wake, for I know it will do me good, and help me through the day.&#x201d;</p><p>Then she opened her new book and began to read. Jo put her arm around her, and, leaning cheek to cheek, read also, with the quiet expression so seldom seen on her restless face.</p><p>&#x201c;How good Meg is! Come, Amy, let&#x2019;s do as they do. I&#x2019;ll help you with the hard words, and they&#x2019;ll explain things if we don&#x2019;t understand,&#x201d; whispered Beth, very much impressed by the pretty books and her sisters&#x2019; example.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad mine is blue,&#x201d; said Amy; and then the rooms were very still while the pages were softly turned, and the winter sunshine crept in to touch the bright heads and serious faces with a Christmas greeting.</p><p>&#x201c;Where is Mother?&#x201d; asked Meg, as she and Jo ran down to thank her for their gifts, half an hour later.</p><p>&#x201c;Goodness only knows. Some poor creeter come a-beggin&#x2019;, and your ma went straight off to see what was needed. There never <i>was</i> such a woman for givin&#x2019; away vittles and drink, clothes and firin&#x2019;,&#x201d; replied Hannah, who had lived with the family since Meg was born, and was considered by them all more as a friend than a servant.</p><p>&#x201c;She will be back soon, I guess; so do your cakes, and have everything ready,&#x201d; said Meg, looking over the presents which were collected in a basket and kept under the sofa, ready to be produced at the proper time. &#x201c;Why, where is Amy&#x2019;s bottle of cologne?&#x201d; she added, as the little flask did not appear.</p><p>&#x201c;She took it out a minute ago, and went off with it to put a ribbon on it, or some such notion,&#x201d; replied Jo, dancing about the room to take the first stiffness off the new army slippers.</p><p>&#x201c;How nice my handkerchiefs look, don&#x2019;t they? Hannah washed and ironed them for me, and I marked them all myself,&#x201d; said Beth, looking proudly at the somewhat uneven letters which had cost her such labor.</p><p>&#x201c;Bless the child; she&#x2019;s gone and put &#x2018;Mother&#x2019; on them instead of M. March; how funny!&#x201d; cried Jo, taking up one.</p><p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it right? I thought it was better to do it so, because Meg&#x2019;s initials are &#x2018;M.M.,&#x2019; and I don&#x2019;t want anyone to use these but Marmee,&#x201d; said Beth, looking troubled.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, dear, and a very pretty idea; quite sensible, too, for no one can ever mistake now. It will please her very much, I know,&#x201d; said Meg, with a frown for Jo and a smile for Beth.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s mother; hide the basket, quick!&#x201d; cried Jo, as a door slammed and steps sounded in the hall.</p><p>Amy came in hastily and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her.</p><p>&#x201c;Where have you been, and what are you hiding behind you?&#x201d; asked Meg, surprised to see, by her hood and cloak, that lazy Amy had been out so early.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t laugh at me, Jo; I didn&#x2019;t mean anyone should know till the time came. I only meant to change the little bottle for a big one, and I gave <i>all</i> my money to get it, and I&#x2019;m truly trying not to be selfish anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>As she spoke, Amy showed the handsome flask which replaced the cheap one; and looked so earnest and humble in her little effort to forget herself that Meg hugged her on the spot and Jo pronounced her &#x201c;a trump,&#x201d; while Beth ran to the window and picked her finest rose to ornament the stately bottle.</p><p>&#x201c;You see I felt ashamed of my present, after reading and talking about being good this morning, so I ran &#x2019;round the corner and changed it the minute I was up; and I&#x2019;m <i>so</i> glad, for mine is the handsomest now.&#x201d;</p><p>Another bang of the street door sent the basket under the sofa and the girls to the table eager for breakfast.</p><p>&#x201c;Merry Christmas, Marmee! Lots of them! Thank you for our books; we read some, and mean to every day,&#x201d; they cried in chorus.</p><p>&#x201c;Merry Christmas, little daughters! I&#x2019;m glad you began at once and hope you will keep on. But I want to say one word before we sit down. Not far away from here lies a poor woman with a little newborn baby. Six children are huddled into one bed to keep from freezing, for they have no fire. There is nothing to eat over there; and the oldest boy came to tell me they were suffering hunger and cold. My girls, will you give them your breakfast as a Christmas present?&#x201d;</p><p>They were all unusually hungry, having waited nearly an hour, and for a minute no one spoke; only a minute, for Jo exclaimed impetuously:</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so glad you came before we began!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;May I go and help carry the things to the poor little children?&#x201d; asked Beth, eagerly.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>I</i> shall take the cream and the muffins,&#x201d; added Amy, heroically giving up the articles she most liked.</p><p>Meg was already covering the buckwheats and piling the bread into one big plate.</p><p>&#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d do it,&#x201d; said Mrs. March, smiling as if satisfied. &#x201c;You shall all go and help me, and when we come back, we will have bread and milk for breakfast and make it up at dinner time.&#x201d;</p><p>They were soon ready, and the procession set out. Fortunately, it was early, and they went through back streets, so few people saw them, and no one laughed at the funny party.</p><p>A poor, bare, miserable room it was, with broken windows, no fire, ragged bedclothes, a sick mother, wailing baby, and a group of pale, hungry children cuddled under one old quilt, trying to keep warm. How the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled, as the girls went in!</p><p>&#x201c;Ach, mein Gott! It is good angels come to us!&#x201d; cried the poor woman, crying for joy.</p><p>&#x201c;Funny angels in hoods and mittens,&#x201d; said Jo, and set them laughing.</p><p>In a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there. Hannah, who had carried wood, made a fire, and stopped up the broken panes with old hats and her own shawl. Mrs. March gave the mother tea and gruel, and comforted her with promises of help, while she dressed the little baby as tenderly as if it had been her own. The girls, meantime, spread the table, set the children round the fire, and fed them like so many hungry birds; laughing, talking, and trying to understand the funny broken English.</p><p>&#x201c;Das ist gute!&#x201d; &#x201c;Der angel-kinder!&#x201d; cried the poor things, as they ate and warmed their purple hands at the comfortable blaze. The girls had never been called angel children before, and thought it very agreeable, especially Jo, who had been considered &#x201c;a Sancho&#x201d; ever since she was born. That was a very happy breakfast, though they didn&#x2019;t get any of it; and when they went away, leaving comfort behind, I think there were not in all the city four merrier people than the hungry little girls who gave away their breakfasts, and contented themselves with bread and milk on Christmas morning.</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s loving our neighbor better than ourselves, and I like it,&#x201d; said Meg, as they set out their presents, while their mother was upstairs collecting clothes for the poor Hummels.</p><p>Not a very splendid show, but there was a great deal of love done up in the few little bundles; and the tall vase of red roses, white chrysanthemums, and trailing vines, which stood in the middle, gave quite an elegant air to the table.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s coming! Strike up, Beth, open the door, Amy. Three cheers for Marmee!&#x201d; cried Jo, prancing about, while Meg went to conduct mother to the seat of honor.</p><p>Beth played her gayest march, Amy threw open the door, and Meg enacted escort with great dignity. Mrs. March was both surprised and touched, and smiled with her eyes full as she examined her presents and read the little notes which accompanied them. The slippers went on at once; a new handkerchief was slipped into her pocket, well scented with Amy&#x2019;s cologne; the rose was fastened in her bosom; and the nice gloves were pronounced &#x201c;a perfect fit.&#x201d;</p><p>There was a good deal of laughing and kissing and explaining, in the simple loving fashion which makes these home festivals so pleasant at the time, so sweet to remember long afterward, and then all fell to work.</p><p>The morning charities and ceremonies took so much time that the rest of the day was devoted to preparations for the evening festivities. Being still too young to go often to the theatre, and not rich enough to afford any great outlay for private performances, the girls put their wits to work, and, necessity being the mother of invention, made whatever they needed. Very clever were some of their productions; pasteboard guitars, antique lamps made of old-fashioned butter-boats covered with silver paper, gorgeous robes of old cotton glittering with tin spangles from a pickle factory, and armour covered with the same useful diamond-shaped bits left in sheets when the lids of tin preserve pots were cut out. The furniture was used to being turned into topsy-turvy, and the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels.</p><p></p></p><h2>Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands (The Schomburg Library of Nineteenth-Century Black Women Writers)</h2><p>Mary Seacole was born a free black woman in Jamaica of the early 19th century. In her long and varied life, she was to travel in Central America, Russia and Europe, find work as a inn-keeper and as a doctress during the Crimean War, and become a famed heroine, the author of her own biography, in Britain. As this autobiography shows, Mary Seacole had a sharp instinct for hypocrisy as well as a ripe taste for sarcasm. Frequently we see her joyfully rise to mock the limitations artificially imposed on her as a black woman. She emerges from her writings as an individual with a most un-Victorian zest for travel, adventure and independence.</p><p>First published in 1857, this autobiographical work by the Jamaican-born nurse Mary Seacole (1805-81) is reissued here in its 1858 printing. It covers her varied and colourful career, most notably the care she provided for wounded soldiers during the Crimean War.No autobiography by an Afro-American woman of the nineteenth century defies classification more than Wonderful Adventures of Mrs. Seacole in Many Lands (1857). A free-born Jamaican, evidently well protected from the tentacles of slavery, Mary Jane Grant Seacole did not write her narrative expressly to advance the cause of antislavery, as so many Afro-American women autobiographers did during her era.</p><h2>LooseLeaf for Essentials of Marketing</h2><p>Essentials of Marketing pioneered an innovative structure&#x2015;using the "Four Ps" framework first introduced by Jerome McCarthy-with a managerial approach.

In Diagramming the Scriptures. . . the curriculum starts with the simple sentence, adds precept upon precept until the learner is able to master complex sentences. . . As each concept is introduced, the student has plenty of practice, followed by quizzes, and later a cumulative test over the entire text. As an educator, a homeschool parent, and a tutor I see this curriculum as an excellent choice for a homeschool, a Christian school classroom, or for an individual of any age who is interested in studying grammar or God&#39;s Word, word by word.&#34; Deana Haines, Families for Home Education Executive Director &#34;. . .I am quite pleased to recommend your book to college professors as an excellent addition to their basic texts in teaching English grammar. . . Since your examples and exercises utilize Bible sentences, your book is also a valuable asset to the study of hermeneutics.&#34; Jim Anderson, Chancellor, Midwestern Baptist College, SBC &#34;Diagramming the Scriptures is a unique way to help focus the Bible student on the words and meanings of Scripture. I commend Shirley Forsen for providing this excellent book and recommend it to all who desire to &#34;go deeper&#34; in their study of God&#39;s Word.&#34; Dr John A Hash, Bible Pathway Ministries &#34;. . .I recommend Diagramming the Scriptures to all scholars to clarify interpretations of all books and to all teachers of grammar.&#34; Glada Kelley, retired teacher and librarian &#34;. . .The best and unique part of Miss Forsen&#39;s book is that Bible verses are used for the examples and exercises. This teaches the student an important aspect of &#34;rightly dividing the word of truth&#34;: understanding how the structure of the verse influences its meaning.

The letters begin in 1942--when, fresh out of high school, Bush volunteered for U.S. Navy flight school--and continue to the brink of the 21st century, as the retired chief executive worries about the Melissa virus infecting his office's server and keeping his visiting grandchildren in line. ("I realize," he muses, "<i>Keep the freezer door closed from now on and I mean it</i> lacks the rhetorical depth of <i>This will not stand</i> or <i>Read my lips</i>.") <i>All the Best</i> hits all the highlights of Bush's career, from the Texas oil business to his role as ambassador to China, then CIA director, vice president under Ronald Reagan, and finally president himself. Along the way, he reveals a personality that is at turns compassionate, respectful, silly, doting, and resolute--a man for whom being a father and a grandfather matters as much as, and maybe even more than, being leader of the free world. Fans and detractors alike will find in <i>All the Best</i> an intimate human portrait that offers as sure a self-definition of Bush's personal life as <i>A World Transformed</i> did his presidential career.<b>George Bush,</b> forty-first president of the United States (1989-1993), is the coauthor with Brent Scowcroft of the 1998 critically acclaimed book <i>A World Transformed.</i> He and his wife, Barbara, live in Houston, Texas, and Kennebunkport, Maine.</p><h2>The Turn of the Screw, the Aspern Papers and Two Stories (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p>&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RThe Turn of the Screw, The Aspern Papers and Two Stories&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, by &amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RHenry James&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R, is part of the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RBarnes &amp; Noble Classics&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;Rseries, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

Sweet&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Turn of the Screw, The Aspern Papers, and Two Stories</i></b> <p><i>The Turn of the Screw, The Aspern Papers and Two Stories</i> brings together for the first time in a single volume four of Henry James&#x2019;s most popular, most anthologized, and most artistically successful stories: the two mentioned by name plus &#x201c;The Beast in the Jungle&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Jolly Corner.&#x201d; At first glance the collection suggests a miscellany, with two long stories and two short ones, two ghost stories and two secular ones, and each, except for the last two, written at very different stages of the author&#x2019;s career. Yet these generic incompatibilities soon yield before the pleasure of discovering a subtle consistency among them. If any one story establishes a framework for this unity, it is <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>, around which the others are formally and thematically involved. But they are involved, perhaps, &#x201c;in a direction unusual&#x201d;&#x2014;as James&#x2019;s narrator-governess describes her own efforts to confront the supernatural by redirecting her sense of the natural. It is this question of imaginatively adjusting the natural, of redeploying and reworking familiar ways of seeing in order to face down the apparently &#x201c;unnatural,&#x201d; that jointly concerns these four fictions.</p><p>James wrote what was to become his most famous tale in the wake of the popular failure of his play <i>Guy Domville</i> in January 1895, when the author was personally subjected to catcalls and boos from the audience on opening night in London, an experience that terminated his cherished desire to be a celebrated dramatist (Edel, <i>Henry James: A Life</i>). After retreating, a week later, to the home of his friend Edward White Benson, the archbishop of Canterbury, James recorded a curious anecdote told by his host about two children in a country house to whom the ghosts of former servants, &#x201c;wicked and depraved&#x201d; (Kaplan, <i>Henry James: The Imagination of Genius: A Biography</i>,), had appeared. It is our first trace of a tale that the author would eventually make his own, most importantly through the creation of the unnamed governess who narrates it. The work is a tour de force of narrative ambiguity in that the reader can never decide whether the governess is protecting her young pupils from real ghosts or hysterically projecting the ghosts in response to deeply repressed libidinal yearnings. Though the latter reading was first proposed almost seventy years ago by the American critic Edmund Wilson and has been subjected to critical reappraisals ever since, it continues to influence much of the discussion of the work today (DeKoven, &#x201c;Gender, History and Modernism in <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>,&#x201d;). </p><p>Even in its initial serialization for <i>Collier&#x2019;s Weekly</i> in 1898, <i>The Turn of the Screw </i>was interpreted by some as an illustration of a psychological disorder rather than as an artfully written tale of the supernatural. James himself urbanely dismissed such interpretations during his lifetime, explaining to various doctors and psychologists that the parallels they detected between his governess and their patients were simply the effects of an overriding artistry: &#x201c;My conscious intention strikes you as having been larger than I deserve it should be thought. It is the intention so primarily, with me, always, of the artist, the painter, that that, is what I most myself feel in it. . . . &#x201d; To Frederic Myers, a colleague of his brother William at the Society for Psychical Research, James&#x2019;s response was more casual: He described the work as &#x201c;a very mechanical matter, I honestly think&#x2014;an inferior, a merely pictorial, subject and rather a shameless potboiler&#x201d; (Kaplan, p. 413). Yet in resisting a psychiatric reading, James enlarges the story&#x2019;s interpretive appeal as an effect of his more encompassing vision&#x2014;one that, for him, necessarily suspended judgment about the spiritual and the demonic as a way of deflecting the relentless, modern disenchantment of the world and reinvesting it with poetic interest. </p><p>James&#x2019;s own youth was not entirely sanitized of the supernatural. His father, a religious freethinker strongly influenced by the writings of Swedenborg, had once had a vision of a &#x201c;damned shape&#x201d; radiating from his &#x201c;fetid personality influences fatal to life&#x201d; (Kaplan, p. 13). And while the youthful Henry insulated himself from many of his father&#x2019;s ideas through an almost defensive shyness, Henry James Senior succeeded in imparting to his son a vivid sense of good and evil. The communication of this sensibility was supplemented by frequent and sustained travels to Europe in restless pursuit of a suitably progressive education for the James children, a quest aided by a comfortable inheritance from Henry Senior&#x2019;s own enterprising father. Thus <i>The Turn of the Screw</i>&#x2014;dictated in Lamb House in Rye, England, which the mature author had purchased because it reminded him of his youth (Knowles, &#x201c;&#x2018;The Hideous Obscure&#x2019;: <i>The Turn of the Screw</i> and Oscar Wilde,&#x201d;)&#x2014;represents a retreat from the glare of public attention and a reexamination of youthful inquiries about the relationship between knowledge and evil.</p></p><h2>Techniques of the Impressionists</h2><p>Works by Manet, Degas, Renoir, Monet, and other artists are examined to reveal the elements of composition, light, color, form, and visual effects that mark the impressionist movement in painting</p><p></p><h2>Sociology: The Essentials (MindTap Course List)</h2><p>SOCIOLOGY: THE ESSENTIALS, Tenth Edition, uses the theme of debunking myths to look behind the facades of everyday life, encourage you to question common assumptions, and help you better understand how society is constructed and sustained.

Using actual speeches from 32 of Shakespeare&#39;s plays, each of the book&#39;s six &#34;scenes&#34; offer proven solutions to such acting problems as delivering spoken subtext, using physical actions to orchestrate a speech, creating images within a speech, dividing a speech into measures, and much more.</p><p><b>SCOTT KAISER&nbsp;</b>is a nationally recognized master teacher of acting and voice, as well as a director, playwright, and author. For 28 seasons, Scott served as a member of the artistic staff at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in Ashland, where he directed, adapted, coached, or performed in all 38 of Shakespeare's plays. Scott is the author of four books on Shakespeare:&nbsp;<i>Have Shakespeare, Will Travel</i>;&nbsp;<i>The Tao of Shakespeare</i>;&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare's Wordcraft</i>; and&nbsp;<i>Mastering Shakespeare</i>. He has also penned several other original plays, including&nbsp;<i>Falstaff in Love</i>,&nbsp;<i>Love's Labor's Won</i>,&nbsp;<i>Now This</i>,&nbsp;<i>Splittin' the Raft</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Shakespeare's Other Women: A New Anthology of Monologues</i>.

Writing in a lively fashion, Huffman makes rich use of primary sources, illustrating events with comments by the people who lived through them: tellers of ancient myths, court women who dominated the early literary world, cynical priests who damned medieval materialism, travelers who marveled at "indecent" Western ballroom dancers in the mid-1800s, and the emperor who justified Pearl Harbor. Without ignoring standard political and military events, the book illuminates economic, social, and cultural factors; it also examines issues of gender as well as the roles of commoners, samurai, business leaders, novelists, and priests.<br></p><p><br><strong>James L.

You would think by now we&#x2019;d have a satisfactory, universal answer. No such luck...Or maybe we do and we just need to look in the right place. For Dr. Jay Lombard that place is the brain, and more importantly the mind, that center of awareness and consciousness that creates reality.<br><br>In <i>The Mind of God</i>, Dr. Lombard employs case studies from his own behavioral neurology practice to explore the spiritual conundrums that we all ask ourselves: What is the nature of God? Does my life have purpose? What's the meaning of our existence? Are we free? What happens to us when we die?<br><br>For Lombard, these metaphysical questions are a jumping-off point for exploring the brain in search of the seat of the soul. It is neuroscience, the author contends, and how we and our brains interpret what&#x2019;s going on around us that can lead us to a deeper and more fulfilling faith.<br><br> Mixing his personal experiences in the medical field (including compelling cases such as the male patient who really thought he was pregnant and a woman who literally scared herself to death) along with his own visionary insight into spiritual experience, Lombard has much to tell us about the nature and power of belief&#x2014;and what we can do to focus our beliefs in a positive direction. <br>If you want to find more meaning in your life or are searching for a deeper understanding of why we believe what we believe, then this book can lead to an exciting transformation in the way you see and understand the world around you. With cutting-edge research and provocative case studies, renowned behavioral neurologist provides insights to some of the most curious spiritual questions of mortality.</p><p>Dr. Jay Lombard, a Board-certified Neurologist, is the co-founder, chief scientific officer, and medical director for Genomind, a precision medicine company for patients with psychiatric and neurological conditions. The company is committed to discovering the underlying causes of neuropsychiatric disorders, and supports the development of personalized medicine for clinical practice. Dr. Lombard has developed a genetic diagnostic test, and has been granted several patents for biomarker diagnostics in psychiatry and neurology. The technology he developed has been regarded by several key opinion leaders as one of the most significant breakthroughs in psychiatry.<p>1</p><p>The Mind of God</p><p>If we discover a complete theory, it should in time be understandable by everyone, not just by a few scientists. Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason--for then we should know the mind of God.</p><p>--Stephen Hawking1</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was 1990 and I was in the beginning of my neurology residency. Under the bright fluorescent lights of the pathology lab at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, I stared at the specimen that shimmered slightly on the cutting board. I had examined several brains by then, but this one looked different. At first I couldn&#x2019;t put my finger on why.</p><p>The brains had been culled from the crop of patients who&#x2019;d died that week at our busy hospital. The neuropathologist had laid out the brains meticulously, stems and all, in front of us medical residents as she did weekly. Her first task was to weigh this particular brain, and it came in at a mere 1,005 grams, a good 10 percent smaller than normal. I peered down at the label on the cover of the clinical report--Female, 5, Haemophilus meningitis. My stomach sank.</p><p>It was a child&#x2019;s brain.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t prepared for that. This was the first pediatric brain I&#x2019;d seen up close. What made my immediate task particularly difficult was that I knew whose brain it was. The brain belonged to a little girl named Sarah. I&#x2019;d seen her only days earlier in the pediatric intensive care unit. A wave of sorrow washed over me, yet I felt another emotion, too--wonder. Sheer wonder. In front of me was the epicenter of Sarah&#x2019;s existence. Every thought this beautiful little girl had ever thought, every dream she&#x2019;d ever dreamed, every hope for a bright and promising future had seemingly originated in this mass of protoplasm. I had to go forward. As is often necessary in my profession, I needed to check these emotions and steel myself for the business at hand. But my mind was on fire. Filled with questions that had no immediate answers.</p><p>When we examined this poor child&#x2019;s brain, we found widespread inflammation of the meninges, the protective membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. From her cranial nerves to the base of her spinal cord, we discovered the remnants of the extreme inflammation that had occupied her skull. Sarah had died of textbook meningitis.</p><p>Sarah had had no prior medical history of meningitis, but that didn&#x2019;t surprise me. I knew the disease&#x2019;s onset can be almost apocalyptic. One day Sarah had been a perfectly healthy five-year-old playing at home with her family. The next day she&#x2019;d experienced a headache that progressively grew worse. The headache was accompanied by fatigue, fever, nausea, and a general sense of unwellness. Her parents had given her Children&#x2019;s Tylenol initially and kept her home. (We&#x2019;ve all felt these symptoms from time to time, and there didn&#x2019;t seem to be any reason for alarm.)</p><p>But when Sarah didn&#x2019;t get better after a day, her parents called their pediatrician, who recommended they take Sarah to the emergency room. No one knew at that point that Sarah was teetering at the door of death. Unfortunately, it proved only a short and tragic hop from the ER to the ICU, where Sarah quickly went downhill. Various tests were rapidly performed there in an attempt to find a solution. Then came a sudden attack. Within Sarah&#x2019;s medical records I read the frantic and heartbreaking attempts at resuscitation.</p><p>Patient coded at 4:35 A.M. CPR performed for 45 mins. Epinephrine, dopamine, &amp; external pacemaker. Unable to establish pulse or maintain BP. Patient declared at 5:18 A.M. Attending physician and family notified.&nbsp;</p><p>The words trailed off in my mind. This was finally how Sarah--her brain, at least--had come to the basement path lab. To me.</p><p>I went back to the task at hand. As I sliced into Sarah&#x2019;s brain, I marveled at how it was still a fleshy pink in parts--and that juxtaposition of pink, girlish life against the gray death of sliced brain matter struck me anew as an incomprehensible paradox. I stared at pieces of the brain, and the big questions of life flooded over me even in the midst of my dissection. Could the gross flesh of Sarah&#x2019;s brain really have possessed the whole elaborate fabric of Sarah&#x2019;s very being--her emotions, memories, hopes, and all the intangibles of her existence? To think that this little girl ate, slept, dreamed, imagined, laughed, told jokes, hugged her parents, and formulated her entire conception of the world around her owing to the power of this mere blob of meat. Surely residing within or perhaps beyond the organ of the brain was something greater, an immaterial primary essence of a person that still survived.</p><p>The light above me flickered in the path lab, threatening to darken the table, the brain in front of me. I considered how billions of people cling to the idea of some kind of afterlife.2 Perhaps they are simply deluded or in denial. But what if they aren&#x2019;t? What if an afterlife is actually plausible? What if we could create a case for it using the rigors of science?</p><p>My questions didn&#x2019;t stop there.</p><p>Here I was, a young physician beginning his life&#x2019;s work in a world of objectivity, only evaluating things I could quantify, and I was faced with life&#x2019;s biggest queries: Was there some other truth I needed to find for myself? Surely there had to be something greater to the end of a human being&#x2019;s life than what Hamlet would call &#x201c;bestial oblivion.&#x201d; But what was this &#x201c;something greater&#x201d;? And could I reconcile it with what I knew of science?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>What Made Sarah Sarah?</p><p>Fast-forward nearly three decades since that day in the path lab. I find myself still a neurologist steeped in neuroscience, still actively engaged in a concrete world of measurements and data. Yet those questions about something existing beyond flesh and form still persist.</p><p>Simply put, neuroscience is the study of the brain--it is the portal through which we can discover, in the brain&#x2019;s formerly fathomless code, the true nature of our being. Yet we are much more than mere intellect, more than human computers who make decisions. The more I&#x2019;ve discovered about the living brain, the more secrets I&#x2019;ve unearthed about the nature of human beings, the universe, the purpose of our lives, and the possible existence of something beyond all of this. For me, neuroscience isn&#x2019;t just the study of the brain; it is a tool by which we can make the invisible visible. As Antoine de Saint-Exup�ry wrote in his masterpiece The Little Prince: &#x201c;What is essential is invisible to the eye.&#x201d;3 No truer words have ever been written. Through an exploration of our brains, we can discover more about the nature of faith, belief, and hope. Thus, there is logical and rational evidence that can help us answer the big questions of life.</p><p>In the pages to come, I want to take you on a cerebral journey--both literal and figurative--into the depths of the mind, to explore the most important questions about life and how neuroscience may help answer them:</p><p>1. Is there a God?</p><p>2. Do humans have souls?</p><p>3. Are we special? (Meaning, are humans any different from other animals?)</p><p>4. Do we have free will--or is all of life predetermined for us?</p><p>5. What&#x2019;s the meaning of life, and is there any higher purpose for our existence?</p><p>6. Since evil exists so prevalently in the world, can there be such a thing as a good God?</p><p>7. Is there life after death?</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>These are questions that have long challenged me to search for answers. Certainly, many contemporary neuroscientists will disagree with my conclusions; they&#x2019;ll argue, for instance, that a person&#x2019;s consciousness--the implicit and yet ubiquitous &#x201c;awareness of being&#x201d;--comes down to neurological switches that are flipped on or off, as in an electrical engineering circuit. For many of these intelligent men and women, whatever happens in our mental state is purely a function of physical (neuronal, biological, or electrochemical) reactions. The general belief among scientists, doctors, and other medical professionals is that we are purely material, with no soul to speak of beyond the elementary particles of chemistry and biology. The majority of neuroscientists assert that there is no physical evidence of an existence beyond the flesh, that any person&#x2019;s subjective sense of self as a soul or immaterial being is an illusion, a simulation designed to hide the actual backroom computations and neuronal workings of our brains.</p><p>Yet when discussing these topics with my colleagues, many of the most humble recognize there are gaps in conventional scientific thinking, spaces yet to be filled in the scientific world--and what can fill those gaps leads back to the reality of the intangible. These gaps are referred to as the &#x201c;hard problem of consciousness,&#x201d;4 a term coined by the eminent philosopher of mind David Chalmers to describe the vast chasm between the physical and the phenomenological, between the tangible senses and the suprasensory experience we have of them.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s look at this a little more closely. While our brains are indeed biological, the experience generated by our brains--our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs--is beyond the observable and measurable. Our subjective perceptions, the qualitative and sentinel aspects of our being, cannot be merely by-products of neurochemical processes. &#x201c;Even if it were able to map out the precise pattern of brain waves that underlie our subjective states, that mapping would only explain the physical correlate of experience, but it wouldn&#x2019;t be them. A person&#x2019;s experiences are as irreducibly real as her brain waves are, and different from them.&#x201d;5 Or to paint another picture, if we are all fish in the fishbowl, how do we observe ourselves outside the fishbowl?</p><p>Consciousness is not something to be feared or dismissed. The Latin roots of the word consciousness mean &#x201c;to know together&#x201d; and hence this distinctly human attribute is a gift that provides us with the capacity to jointly inquire about the meaning of our existence. If we were able to unwrap this gift, we would see that the perceived gaps between flesh and spirit, mind and brain, hide a deeper, intrinsic, and fascinating reality. This reality is an experience of something ineffable--a mind, soul, spirit, or even energy--that which is both irreducibly complex and fundamental to our being.</p><p>Is it what made Sarah Sarah? What makes me me? What makes you you?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Faith in Science</p><p>Now, I am first and foremost a neurologist who is deeply vested in empirical data. I hold great faith in science. I, and millions of other physicians and scientists, have staked our professional careers on the integrity of the scientific method, which has proved to be extremely useful to help predict and manipulate natural, chemical, and biological phenomena. By no means do we want to ignore science in this process of discovery. To the contrary, we want to use science as a stepping-stone to learn and know and grasp all we can about who we are. I realize the very idea that truth can be found both &#x201c;within&#x201d; and &#x201c;beyond&#x201d; science can be difficult, if not impossible, for some people to grasp, particularly for us scientists--remember all those fish in the fishbowl. But with science, faith, and a little bit of reasoning, we can press our faces upon the glass and see that there is something beyond, and it&#x2019;s extraordinary.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Science Is the Only Truth?</p><p>As I&#x2019;ve alluded to earlier, there are many who believe that science is the only truth. Yet truth can be found both &#x201c;within&#x201d; science and &#x201c;beyond&#x201d; science. Truth can be found in philosophy, literature, art, music, and history. Truth can be found in the stuff of life that&#x2019;s beyond what is fully measurable or seen. The famous physicist Max Planck expressed a similar sentiment: &#x201c;Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.&#x201d;6</p><p>In other words, fish in a fishbowl.</p><p>Some people will label these further forms of truth the same as faith, but I&#x2019;m not completely comfortable with that term either. Faith is such a loaded word, so personal and charged, so full of various connotations. People talk about taking a blind leap of faith, or stepping out on faith into the great unknown. But that kind of faith is far too limited. The kind of faith I&#x2019;m talking about in this book doesn&#x2019;t ask us to suspend facts. By contrast, it calls us to examine the facts and then build upon them. The faith I&#x2019;m talking about (if we even want to call it faith, but for argument&#x2019;s sake we will) is a faith informed by science, measurability, and logic, not by blindness. This faith asks: What if there were actually very good reasons to believe in the intangible? What is faith? Faith means accepting that there is a greater reality beyond our senses and our intellect. We can use our intellect to instruct us on how we should live our lives, but faith teaches us about the meaning and purpose of our existence. What if there are very good reasons to hold to and live by the veracity of that which cannot be seen?</p><p>As a scientist and as a human being who has grappled with the meaning of faith in my own life and with many patients struggling to comprehend whether life has some deeper significance beyond the here and now, I believe it is possible to develop an appreciation of both the biological and the transcendent, and to explore how each can inform the other in positive ways. There must be a balance.</p><p>We must have science.</p><p>And we must have faith.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>1.

The rebels swept through Southampton County, Virginia, recruiting slaves to their ranks and killing nearly five dozen whites-more than had ever been killed in any slave revolt in American history. Although a hastily assembled group of whites soon suppressed the violence, its repercussions had far-reaching consequences.<br><br>In <em>The Land Shall Be Deluged in Blood</em>, Patrick H. Breen uses the dramatic events in Southampton to explore the terrible choices faced by members of the local black community as they considered joining the rebels, a choice that would likely cost them their lives, supporting their masters, or somehow avoiding taking sides. Combining fast-paced narrative with rigorous analysis, Breen shows how, as whites regained control, slaveholders created an account of the revolt that saved their slaves from white retribution, the most dangerous threat facing the slaveholders' human property. By probing the stories slaveholders told that allowed them to get non-slaveholders to protect slave property, <em>The Land Shall Be Deluged in Blood </em>reveals something surprising about both the fragility and power of slavery.<br></p><p><br><strong>Patrick H.

Breen's The Land Shall Be Deluged in Blood goes further than any book to date to set the record straight, revealing just how fascinating the story of the Southampton slave rebellion is when stripped of suspect agendas. His book is most enlightening in the Afterword, in which he meticulously deconstructs Turner's prison interview with attorney Thomas R. Gray--published in November 1831 as "The Confessions of Nat Turner"--which the historian calls "the most important work on slavery written and published in the slaveholding South."&nbsp;Did Turner really spill his story to Gray? Did Gray transcribe and compile it accurately?&nbsp;Breen's brilliant breakdown alone makes The Land Shall Be Deluged in Blood an essential work. --Steve Nathans-Kelly</p><h2>Honda Pilot Acura MDX: Honda Pilot - 2003 thru 2007 - Acura MDX - 2001 thru 2007 (Haynes Repair Manual)</h2><p><p>Haynes offers the best coverage for cars, trucks, vans, SUVs and motorcycles on the market today.

From there Staloff offers a broadened conception of the interstices of political, social, and intellectual authority in Puritan Massachusetts and beyond, arguing that ideologies, as well as ideological politics, are produced by self-conscious, and often class-conscious, thinkers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Darren Staloff</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at City College of New York.<br><br>"An invigorating contribution to the scholarly literature on Puritan New England--original in perspective, forceful in argument, and graceful in presentation. In Staloff's sophisticated retelling, the emergence to authority in Massachusetts of certain intellectuals (clergymen) and intelligentsia (magistrates) as a 'thinking class' shaped the Puritan stronghold's politics and cultural life until 1686. By reading the sources with an uncommonly keen eye for the nuances of power, Staloff sheds new light on many heretofore slighted aspects of Massachusetts history as well as such old chestnuts as the banishing of Roger Williams, the squelching the Quakers, and the jousting over the Halfway Covenant. [Staloff] also offers perceptive new assessments of the Bay Colony's major personalities, including John Cotton, Thomas Hooker, and Increase Mather. Old hands at Puritan studies as well as newcomers to the field will profit immensely from this insightful book."--Alden T. Vaughan, Columbia University<p></p><br>"In all probability, [Staloff's book] will quickly become the one book that everyone will read and assign to get into the mind and culture of Puritan New England."--John M. Murrin, Princeton University<p></p><br>"Darren Staloff's analytical categories of class and power provide the structure for what is both an excellent social history of political conflicts and a useful political history of religious events. His account gives new, provocative twists to old stories like the Hutchinson trial, disputes over the charter, and the Halfway Covenant...Staloff's dramatic and nuanced narrative reveals not only the interplay of class and power but also the considerable influence of personalities and ideas."--illiam and Mary Quarterly<p></p><br>"It offers a genuinely ironical way to understand the New England Puritans' lurch into modernity, a topic of neverending interest to scholars in this field."--<em>Reviews in American History</em><p></p><br>"Staloff presents a provocative argument. It is a thoughtful, intelligent work, one that considers the Puritan elite as dynamic and self-interested. The book is certain to rekindle interest (if it ever died out) in the intellectual history of the Puritans in New England and show us how we can use innovations from other fields, such as sociology, to refine our thinking about history."--<em>The New England Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"Darren Staloff's compact, closely reasoned book provides the best account to date of the institutional means by which the values of Protestant Christianity, whether contained in the Calvinist Federal Theology or the biblicism of the primitive churches, grew to power in Massachusetts, became pervasive, and then waned...To Staloff's great credit, one finishes his book convinced that such notoriously slippery yet monolithic terms as 'the intelligentsia' or 'thinking class' were, in the instance of the seventeenth-century Massachusetts, both identifiable and accurate."--<em>Early American</em> <em>Literature</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Grammar and Beyond Level 3 Student&#39;s Book</h2><p>Based on extensive research, Grammar and Beyond ensures that students study accurate information about grammar and apply it in their own speech and writing.

This book presents a revolutionary new understanding of the concept of depression and offers readers skills and strategies to manage it. &nbsp;</p><p>No longer is this a one-size-fits-all diagnosis, and antidepressants are no longer the one-size-fits-all treatment. Mood disorders are now seen to form a spectrum of problems, from common depression on one end to full bipolar disorder on the other. In between these extremes are multitudes of people who are on the middle of the mood spectrum, and this book is for them.</p><p>The first part of the book helps readers answer the question, &#x201c;Where am I on the mood spectrum?&#x201d; By laying the foundation for understanding this spectrum, Aiken and Phelps highlight the key distinctions that define unipolarity, bipolarity, hypomania, mania, and depression. Readers will be able to discern which definition best fits their experience, and use this understanding to learn which treatment methods will work best. &nbsp;</p><p>The authors also empower readers to look beyond antidepressants. They walk readers through new medications for the mood spectrum, and offer a guide to non-medication treatments that anyone can use on their own, from diet and lifestyle changes to natural supplements. The book also discusses other innovative technologies that can aid in recovery, including dawn simulators, mood apps, and blue-light filters. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>This thoughtful and beneficial book will offer readers skills and strategies, as well as hope, in the face of debilitating mental challenges.</p></p><p><p><strong>Chris Aiken, MD,</strong> is the director of the Mood Treatment Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and an instructor at the Wake Forest University School of Medicine.

When antidepressants and therapy alone don't work,&nbsp;<em>Bipolar, Not So Much</em>&nbsp;offers insights into what may be the real diagnosis. This informative book gives important clues to better identify the different shades of depressive and bipolar disorders. From those clues, it guides people towards the steps they need to recover. It includes up-to-date reviews of medications, natural and lifestyle approaches, as well as useful tips for living more effectively with mood problems in relationships and at work.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Richard Weisler, MD, Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Adjunct Associate Professor of Psychiatry, Duke University Medical Center</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Explaining the concept of the mood disorder spectrum can be a formidable task for any psychiatric provider.

These include the takeover of Congress from the seemingly entrenched Hindu nationalist party in 2004, India&#39;s huge advances in technology and the country&#39;s new role as a major player in world affairs. From the days of the Mughals, through the British Empire, and into Independence, the country has been transformed by its institutional structures. It is these institutions which have helped bring about the social, cultural and economic changes that have taken place over the last half century and paved the way for the modern success story. Despite these advances, poverty, social inequality and religious division still fester. In response to these dilemmas, the book grapples with questions of caste and religious identity, and the nature of the Indian nation.</p><p>A revised and updated history of modern India, including the latest developments from the end of the twentieth century and a new conclusion.

Sex, drugs, work, money, infatuation with the occult and spiritual healing -- these are the remarkably modern themes that animate <i>Twilight Sleep.</i> The extended family of Mrs. Manford is determined to escape the pain, boredom and emptiness of life through whatever form of "twilight sleep" they can devise or procure. And though the characters and their actions may seem more in keeping with today's society, this is still a classic Wharton tale of the upper crust and its undoing -- wittily, masterfully told.</p><p>America's most famous woman of letters, and the first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize, <b>Edith Wharton</b> was born into one of the last "leisured class" families in New York City, as she put it, in 1862. Educated privately, she was married to Edward Wharton in 1885, and for the next few years they spent their time in the high society of Newport, Rhode Island, then Lenox, Massachusetts, and Europe. It was in Europe that Wharton first met Henry James, who was to have a profound and lasting influence on her life and work. Wharton's first published book was a work of nonfiction in collaboration with Ogden Codman, <i>The Decoration of Houses</i> (1897), but from early on, her marriage had been a source of distress, and she was advised by her doctor to write fiction to relieve her nervous tension. Wharton's first short stories appeared in <i>Scribner's Magazine,</i> and although she published several volumes of fiction around the turn of the century, including <i>The Greater Inclination</i> (1899), <i>The Touchstone</i> (1900), <i>Crucial Instances</i> (1901), <i>The Valley of Decision</i> (1902), <i>Sanctuary</i> (1903), and <i>The Descent of Man and Other Stories</i> (1904), it was not until the publication of the bestselling <i>The House of Mirth</i> in 1905 that she was recognized as one of the most important novelists of her time for her keen social insight and subtle sense of satire. In 1906 Wharton visited Paris, which inspired <i>Madame de Treymes</i> (1907), and made her home there in 1907, finally divorcing her husband in 1912. The years before the outbreak of World War I represent the core of her artistic achievement with the publication of <i>Ethan Frome</i> in 1911, <i>The Reef</i> in 1912, and <i>The Custom of the Country</i> in 1913. During the war she remained in France organizing relief for Belgian refugees, for which she was later awarded the Legion of Honor. She also wrote two novels about the war, <i>The Marne</i> (1918) and <i>A Son at the Front</i> (1923), and although living in France she continued to write about New England and the Newport society she knew so well and described in <i>Summer</i> (1917), the companion to <i>Ethan Frome,</i> and <i>The Age of Innocence</i> (1920), for which she won the Pulitzer Prize. Her other works include <i>Old New York</i> (1924), <i>The Mother's Recompense</i> (1925), <i>The Writing of Fiction</i> (1925), <i>The Children</i> (1928), <i>Hudson River Bracketed</i> (1929), and her autobiography, <i>A Backward Glance</i> (1934). She died in France in 1937.Edith Wharton&nbsp;(1862&#x2013;1937) was an American novelist&#x2014;the first woman to win a Pulitzer Prize for her novel&nbsp;<i>The Age of Innocence&nbsp;</i>in 1921&#x2014;as well as a short story writer, playwright, designer, reporter, and poet. Born into one of New York's elite families, she drew upon her knowledge of upper class aristocracy to realistically portray the lives and morals of the Gilded Age.</p><h2>Walking on Water: Reading, Writing and Revolution</h2><p><p>Remember the days of longing for the hands on the classroom clock to move faster? Most of us would say we love to learn, but we hated school. Why is that? What happens to creativity and individuality as we pass through the educational system?</p> <p><em>Walking on Water</em> is a startling and provocative look at teaching, writing, creativity, and life by a writer increasingly recognized for his passionate and articulate critique of modern civilization. This time Derrick Jensen brings us into his classroom--whether college or maximum security prison--where he teaches writing. He reveals how schools perpetuate the great illusion that happiness lies outside of ourselves and that learning to please and submit to those in power makes us into lifelong clock-watchers. As a writing teacher Jensen guides his students out of the confines of traditional education to find their own voices, freedom, and creativity.</p> <p>Jensen's great gift as a teacher and writer is to bring us fully alive at the same moment he is making us confront our losses and count our defeats. It is at the center of Walking on Water, a book that is not only a hard-hitting and sometimes scathing critique of our current educational system and not only a hands-on method for learning how to write, but, like Julia Cameron's <em>The Artist's Way</em>, a lesson on how to connect to the core of our creative selves, to the miracle of waking up and arriving breathless (but with dry feet) on the far shore.</p></p><p><p>Derrick Jensen is the prize-winning author of <em>A Language Older than Words, The Culture of Make Believe, Listening to the Land, Strangely Like War, Welcome to the Machine</em>, and <em>Walking on Water</em>. He was one of two finalists for the 2003 J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize, which cited <em>The Culture of Make Believe</em> as "a passionate and provocative meditation on the nexus of racism, genocide, environmental destruction and corporate malfeasance, where civilization meets its discontents." He writes for The New York Times Magazine, Audubon, and The Sun Magazine among many others.&nbsp; He is an environmental activist and lives on the coast of northern California.</p><p><em><strong>Publishers Weekly-</strong></em><br><br>Writing teacher Jensen doesn't believe in the traditional grading system, which he calls "a cudgel to bludgeon the unwilling into doing what they don't want to do," so he opts instead to give his students at Eastern Washington University check marks: one check mark for turning in a piece of writing, four for editing that writing into perfection. For this opinionated offering on writing, teaching and the state of the world, Jensen deserves four checkmarks for courage. His ideas are always radical and often inspiring. He rails against the public education system frequently and with refreshing humor, telling students their papers "have to be good enough&#x2014;interesting enough&#x2014;that I would rather read them than make love." Drawing on his personal experience, he castigates what he sees as formal education's lack of creativity and flexibility for personal style. Jensen's strength lies in his honest, provocative, passionate approach. The rawness of his ideas is this book's virtue, but it's also its vice. When Jensen makes seemingly random forays into commentary on the demise of the environment or political consciousness (subjects he explored in earlier books like The Culture of Make Believe), his writing becomes long-winded and unfocused. He loses sight of his own seventh rule of writing, which he so dramatically relays to his students: clarity. But more importantly, Jensen's first, second, third and fourth rules of writing are "Don't bore the reader." In that effort, he succeeds masterfully.</p><br><br><p>"[Jensen]...deftly wraps his politics in humor, poignant teacher-student encounters and a clear passion for young minds. Jensen is an important, alternative voice of our times."--<strong><em>Mercury News</em></strong></p><br><br><p>"The clarity and force of these ideas cut like a scalpel in the hands of a surgeon, preserving the vital, removing the diseased. Mr. Jensen burns sharp holes in the dark places of those rituals we have been tricked into believing are education. We owe him a debt of gratitude for these transformational insights.

This period saw Britain's greatest expansion as an empire-builder and a dominant world power.<br> <br> We begin with several thematic chapters--some are on Britain while others consider the empire's periphery--exploring the key dynamics of British expansion that made imperial influence possible and imperial rule prevalent. The volume also studies the economic, cultural, and institutional frameworks that shaped Britain's overseas empire. Focus then shifts to the principal areas of imperial activity overseas, including both white-settler and tropical colonies, and the question of how British interests and imperial rule shaped the political, social, and economic histories of individual regions. The themes include economics, institutions, defense, technology, imperial and colonial cultures, science, and exploration. The volume examines not only the formal empire, stretching from Australasia and the West Indies to India and the African colonies, but also China and Latin America, which were the central components of Britain's "informal" empire.<br> <br> <em>About the Series</em>:<br> <br> <em>The Oxford History of the British Empire</em> is a major new assessment of the Empire in the light of recent scholarship and the progressive opening of historical records. It deals with the interaction of British and non-western societies from the Elizabethan era to the late twentieth century, provides a balanced treatment of the ruled as well as the rulers, and takes into account the significance of the Empire for the peoples of the British Isles.

It contains the complete text of every point made in that book. </p> <p> You can use it either to review the meaning of an accounting term or to review an entire topic. Usually, the easiest way to review a term is to look it up in the Glossary. The Glossary gives a short explanation. If you want a longer explanation with examples, the Glossary will refer you to the proper page in the text. </p> <p> If you want to review a whole topic, you can refer to the Table of Contents for the part and section in which the topic is discussed. </p> <p> If you have been introduced to accounting by another book, you can review terms or topics in the same way. However, this book, as is the case with all accounting texts, is not by itself a satisfactory way of learning the subject. Students need the "hands-on" experience that is provided by the programmed text or the computer. </p></p><h2>The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes</h2><p>"The ultimate book for both the dabbler and serious scholar--. [Hughes] is sumptuous and sharp, playful and sparse, grounded in an earthy music--. This book is a glorious revelation."--Boston Globe<br><br>Spanning five decades and comprising 868 poems (nearly 300 of which have never before appeared in book form), this magnificent volume is the definitive sampling of a writer who has been called the poet laureate of African America--and perhaps our greatest popular poet since Walt Whitman.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, for the first time, are all the poems that Langston Hughes published during his lifetime, arranged in the general order in which he wrote them and annotated by Arnold Rampersad and David Roessel.<br><br>Alongside such famous works as "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" and Montage of a Dream Deferred, <b>The Collected Poems</b> includes the author's lesser-known verse for children; topical poems distributed through the Associated Negro Press; and poems such as "Goodbye Christ" that were once suppressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Lyrical and pungent, passionate and polemical, the result is a treasure of a book, the essential collection of a poet whose words have entered our common language.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>Langston Hughes was born in Joplin, Missouri, in 1902.&nbsp;&nbsp;After graduation from high school, he spent a year in Mexico with his father, then a year studying at Columbia University.&nbsp;&nbsp;His first poem in a nationally known magazine was "The Negro Speaks of Rivers," which appeared in Crisis in 1921.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1925, he was awarded the First Prize for Poetry of the magazine <b>Opportunity</b>, the winning poem being "The Weary Blues," which gave its title to his first book of poems, published in 1926.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of his poetry, Mr. Hughes received a scholarship at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania, where he won his B.A. in 1929.&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1943, he was awarded an honorary Litt.D. by his alma mater; he has also been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship (1935), a Rosenwald Fellowship (1940), and an American Academy of Arts and Letters Grant (1947).&nbsp;&nbsp;From 1926 until his death in 1967, Langston Hughes devoted his time to writing and lecturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;He wrote poetry, short stories, autobiography, song lyrics, essays, humor, and plays.&nbsp;&nbsp;A cross section of his work was published in 1958 as <b>The Langston Hughes Reader</b>.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i><b>Juke Box Love Song</b><br><br>I could take the Harlem night<br>and wrap around you,<br>Take the neon lights and make a crown,<br>Take the Lenox Avenue busses,<br>Taxis, subways,<br>And for your love song tone their rumble down.<br>Take Harlem's heartbeat,<br>Make a drumbeat,<br>Put it on a record, let it whirl,<br>And while we listen to it play,<br>Dance with you till day--<br>Dance with you, my sweet brown Harlem girl.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun? How Reginald Lewis Created a Billion-Dollar Business Empire</h2><p>"Voyages deep into the frenzied, complex world of LBO transactions."&#x2014;<i>BusinessWeek</i>. <p>"Sheds light on an important chapter in both African-American and American business history."&#x2014;Earl G. Graves, Publisher, <i>Black Enterprise</i> magazine.</p> <p>When Reginald Lewis was six years old, his grandparents asked his opinion about employment discrimination against blacks. Reg replied simply, "Why should white guys have all the fun?" Why, indeed!

At the time of his death in 1993, his personal fortune was estimated at $400 million.</p> <p>"<i>Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?</i>" traces Lewis's rise from a working- class neighborhood in east Baltimore to Harvard Law School and ultimately into the elite circle of Wall Street deal-makers. Expanding on Lewis's unfinished autobiography, journalist Blair Walker completes a vivid portrait of a proud, fiercely determined man with a razor-sharp tongue&#x2014;and an intellect to match. He shows how Lewis's lifelong hunger for wealth and personal glory fueled his success on the playing field, in the classroom, and in the boardroom. Walker also provides a rare insider's view of Lewis, the iron-willed negotiator and brilliant business strategist in action as he finesses one phenomenal deal after another.</p> <p>A moving saga of personal courage and determination as well as a virtual how-to book for those who would like to follow in Lewis's footsteps, "<i>Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?</i>" is every bit as memorable as the man whose story it tells.</p></p><p>"Why should white guys have all the fun?" One of Reginald Lewis&#x2019;s earliest childhood memories was of hearing his grandparents talk of employment discrimination against African-Americans. When asked for his opinion on the subject, six-year-old Reg simply replied: "Why should white guys have all the fun?" Why, indeed! This precociously self-assured boy would grow up to become the wealthiest black man in history and one of the most successful entrepreneurs of all time. Profiled in Forbes magazine as one of the four-hundred wealthiest businesspeople in America, Lewis reigned over a commercial empire spanning four continents. At the time of his death in 1993, his personal fortune was estimated by Forbes to be in excess of $400 million. Having apprenticed in the art of the leveraged buyout while head of his own successful Wall Street law firm, he went on to mastermind some of the most spectacular deals ever, including the $1 billion purchase of food giant Beatrice International&#x2014;one of the largest leveraged buyouts ever. A noted art collector and connoisseur, he was also a celebrated philanthropist who gave away a vast fortune to charity. Yet despite the notoriety surrounding Lewis&#x2019;s financial coups, until now, little has been written about the life of this remarkable but private man. Based on Reginald Lewis&#x2019;s unfinished autobiography as well as scores of interviews with family, friends, and colleagues, "Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?" cuts through the myth and media hype to reveal the man behind the legend. What emerges is a vivid portrait of a proud, fiercely determined individual with a razor-sharp tongue&#x2014;and an intellect to match&#x2014;who would settle for nothing less than excellence from himself and others. Tracing Lewis&#x2019;s rise from an east Baltimore working-class neighborhood to Harvard Law School and ultimately into the elite circle of Wall Street deal-makers, journalist Blair Walker shows how Lewis&#x2019;s lifelong hunger for wealth and personal achievement drove him to success at whatever he turned his hand to. Walker also provides us with a rare insider&#x2019;s view of Lewis, the iron-willed negotiator and brilliant business strategist in action as he finesses one phenomenal deal after another. An inspiring tale of a remarkable man&#x2019;s victory against overwhelming odds, "Why Should White Guys Have All the Fun?" is a book as memorable as the man whose story it tells.<b>REGINALD F.

Unfortunately for him, the convoy of which he was part was stopped by partisans and his features, made so familiar by Fascist propaganda, gave him away. Within 24 hours he was executed by his captors, joining those he sent early to their graves as an outcome of his tyranny, at least one million people.<br><br> He was one of the tyrant-killers who so scarred interwar Europe, but we cannot properly understand him or his regime by any simple equation with Hitler or Stalin. Like them, his life began modestly in the provinces; unlike them, he maintained a traditonal male family life, including both wife and mistresses, and sought in his way to be an intellectual. He was cruel (though not the cruellist); his racism existed, but never without the consistency and vigor that would have made him a good recruit for the SS. He sought an empire; but, in the most part, his was of the old-fashioned, costly, nineteenth century variety, not a racial or ideological imperium. And, self-evidently Italian society was not German or Russian: the particular patterns of that society shaped his dictatorship.<br><br> Bosworth's <em>Mussolini</em> allows us to come closer than ever before to an appreciation of the life and actions of the man and of the political world and society within which he operated. With extraordinary skill and vividness, drawing on a huge range of sources, this biography paints a picture of brutality and failure, yet one tempered with an understanding of Mussolini as a human being, not so different from many of his contemporaries.</p><p>The new edition of this award-winning biography contains fresh insights into one of history's most intriguing figures. By emphasizing the impact of political and social upheaval in shaping Mussolini's image, Bosworth skillfully juxtaposes his subject's renowned brutality against his inner compassion. <i>Mussolini </i>never fails to grip.<br><strong>Richard Bosworth</strong> is one of the world's leading authorities on modern Italian history.
